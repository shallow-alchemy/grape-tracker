let's clean up the docs. Please _thoroughly_ read the context, deployment, engineering principles, test_coverage gaps, test_coverage summary, zero-provider fix, and code clean up docs.

Think of a way that we can break these docs up into pillars of knowledge for:
testing
deploying
react
typescript
zero
product decision making
architectural patterns
app specific "how to" - like commands and how to use
rust
api documentation
other backend considerations
simple "catch up" documentation for future ai agents

Let's make sure we don't lose any context or insight, but let's refactor thes docs into a more structured form that would help of find what we need when we need it
