# Bordeaux Red Grape Varietal Profiles: Comprehensive Technical Database

Five classic Bordeaux red varieties—Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec—each require distinct climate parameters, management approaches, and winemaking techniques. This database provides explicit thresholds, specific ranges, and queryable data points organized for vineyard management applications. **Key finding**: Cabernet Franc offers superior cold hardiness among vinifera reds (surviving to **-10°F**), while Petit Verdot demands the longest season (**1,672 GDD** to maturity) but delivers unmatched color intensity. Merlot ripens earliest but faces high botrytis and coulure risk, making rootstock selection critical.

|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Row width | 8-10 ft | 9-10 ft minimum |
| Vine spacing | 4-6 ft | 6-8 ft |
| Training system | VSP (4 tons/acre) | **Lyre recommended (6 tons/acre)** |

**Crop load targets**:
- Commercial: 3-4 tons/acre (VSP), up to 6 tons/acre (Lyre)
- Small-scale: 10-15 lbs/vine
- Balance ratio: 5 lbs fruit : 1 lb pruning weight

**Canopy management CRITICAL for pyrazine reduction**:
- Leaf removal shortly after fruit set, then 30 and 50 days after
- Early thinning reduces IBMP (pyrazine) accumulation
- Multiple hedging passes required

**Cold climate strategies**:
- Multiple trunk training (insurance against winter kill)
- Hill soil over graft unions before winter
- Delayed pruning to assess bud damage

**Rootstock recommendations**:
- Cold climates: **3309C** (most popular NE), 101-14 Mgt, Riparia Gloire
- Crown gall resistance: Riparia Gloire

| Skin contact | 7-10 days (light) | 14-21 days (full) |
| **Oak preference** | **LIGHTER OAK** | Preserve varietal character |
| New oak % | 20-40% | Light-medium toast |
| Aging potential | Light: 2-5 yrs; Premium: 10-20+ yrs |

**Pyrazine management in winery**: Inactivated dry yeast (Noblesse), untoasted oak chips (2-4 g/L) can mask vegetal character.

### Blending profile

**Contributes**: Intense floral aromatics (violets), silky refined texture, freshness, pencil shavings complexity.

| Blend style | Cab Franc % | Role |
|-------------|------------|------|
| Left Bank Bordeaux | 0-10% | "Third violin"—aromatics |
| Right Bank Bordeaux | **10-40%** | Backbone, significant role |
| Château Cheval Blanc | 40-56% | Co-dominant |
| Château Ausone | 55-65% | Dominant |
| Loire single varietal | **100%** | Chinon, Bourgueil, Saumur-Champigny |

### Flavor profile and pyrazine discussion

| Climate | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Cool (Loire-style) | Raspberry, red currant, violets, **bell pepper** (desirable when balanced), graphite; light-medium body |
| Moderate | Red/black cherry, tobacco, cedar, pencil shavings; medium+ body, moderate tannins |
| Warm | Black cherry, dried fruit, spice; may lose distinctive varietal character |

**Pyrazine threshold**: Detection at 10-15 parts per trillion—extremely potent. Cab Franc has second-highest pyrazine levels among Bordeaux varieties (Carménère highest).

**When herbaceous is desirable**: Traditional Loire style, adds complexity and typicity. **When it's a flaw**: Excessive/unbalanced, dominates fruit, associated with underripe fruit or shaded canopies.

## Petit Verdot: The late-ripening color bomb

Petit Verdot requires the **longest growing season** of all Bordeaux varieties, needing **1,672 GDD** for maturity—152 GDD more than Cabernet Sauvignon. In Bordeaux, it fully ripens "once every four years." However, in warmer regions like Virginia, California, and Australia, Petit Verdot thrives as both a blending component (contributing exceptional color and tannin) and increasingly as a single varietal.

### Climate requirements—heat is essential

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **GDD to maturity** | **1,672 GDD (base 10°C)** | Latest of major Bordeaux varieties |
| **Minimum region** | Region III (2,500-3,000 GDD°F) | Marginal |
| **Optimal region** | **Region IV-V (3,000-4,000+ GDD°F)** | Best performance |
| **Comparison to Cab Sauv** | Needs 10+ more warm days | Cab Sauv matures at 1,520 GDD |
| **Cold hardiness** | **7°F advantage over Cab Sauv** | Virginia Tech data |
| **Frost sensitivity** | HIGH | Early budding + late ripening = risky combination |

### Phenology data

| Stage | GDD (base 10°C) | Timing |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Bud break | 54 GDD | **Early**—4 days after Chasselas |
| Flowering | 367 GDD | Mid-season |
| Veraison | 1,206 GDD | **Very late** |
| Harvest | **1,672 GDD** | 3.5-4 weeks after Chasselas |

**Hendry Winery (Napa) 2019 example**:
- Budbreak: April 3
- Bloom: May 29-31
- Veraison: August 10-15
- Harvest: October 6-11
- **Bloom to harvest: 130 days**

**Harvest order**: Merlot → Cab Franc → Cab Sauv → **Petit Verdot (LAST)**—often 2+ weeks after Cab Sauv.

### Disease susceptibility matrix

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery mildew | **LOW** | "Little sensitive" |
| Downy mildew | MODERATE | Standard |
| Botrytis | LOW-MODERATE | Thick skins, small berries, loose clusters help |
| **Millerandage (poor fruit set)** | **PRIMARY CONCERN** | Name means "little green"—berries fail to develop |
| Phylloxera | HIGH | Rootstock required |

**Millerandage notes**: Requires optimal weather during flowering (warm, sunny, dry). Cool, wet, windy conditions during bloom cause severe fruit set failure. Temperature below 50°F (10°C) during flowering damages ovules.

### Vineyard management specifications

**Vigor**: MODERATE-HIGH with weak/fragile shoots at base requiring careful trellising. Unique characteristic: **produces more than two clusters per shoot**.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Row width | 8-11 ft (8-10 ft most common) |
| Vine spacing | 4-7 ft |
| Training system | VSP (2-4 tons), Lyre, cane pruning preferred |
| Commercial yield | 2.5-4 tons/acre (quality focused) |
| Small-scale | 6-12 lbs/vine |
| Shoots per vine | 6-10 |

**Canopy management**: High needs due to vigor; may require two passes for shoot thinning. Leaf removal at bloom recommended.

**Rootstock recommendations** (Chinese study 2014-2018):
1. **3309C**—#1 ranked, low-moderate vigor, excellent quality
2. **101-14M**—#2, highest TSS, phenolics, anthocyanins
3. **110R**—#3, for drought tolerance
4. 5BB, SO4, 5C—higher yields, more vigorous

### Winemaking parameters—pH management critical

| Parameter | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Harvest Brix | 23-26° | Virginia avg: 23.2-24.4° |
| Harvest pH | 3.4-3.75 | Watch for high K driving pH up |
| Harvest TA | 5.5-7.5 g/L | Virginia avg: 7.2 g/L |
| **Potassium** | 1250-1340 mg/L | **HIGH K = pH management critical** |
| Fermentation temp | 79-82°F (26-28°C) | |
| Cold soak | 3-5 days | Extract color, floral character |
| Skin contact | **25+ days beneficial** | Extended maceration increases color, tannin |
| New oak % | 55-80% | Can handle significant new oak |
| Barrel time | 15-30 months | 15-18 standard |
| Aging potential | **10-20+ years** | Excellent longevity |

**Key challenge**: High potassium in skins causes TA drop and pH rise during fermentation. Final wine pH often ~4.0 even with attractive harvest pH. **Solution**: 2 g/L tartaric acid at crush (Virginia research).

### Blending profile—small addition, big impact

**Contributes**: Dense violet-black color, firm tannic backbone, violet/floral aromatics, acidity retention, longevity.

| Usage | Typical % | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Bordeaux traditional | **1-5%** | Often 0% in cool years |
| California Meritage | 5-15% | Color/structure enhancement |
| Château Bolaire | Up to 40% | Bordeaux exception |
| Virginia/Australia varietal | **100%** | Regional success story |

**Virginia success**: 3rd most planted variety (~300 acres); multiple Governor's Cup winners as 100% Petit Verdot.

### Flavor profile by climate

| Climate | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Cool | Often fails to ripen—green, vegetal, harsh tannins |
| Moderate | Blackberry, violet emerging, firm tannins |
| **Warm/Hot (optimal)** | Plum, blackberry, blueberry; **violet, lilac, lavender** (signature); sage, leather, tobacco, graphite; very deep inky color |

**Signature**: Young wine shows banana, pencil shavings; mature wine develops **violets**, leather, plum.

## Malbec: The altitude-loving colorist

Malbec (Côt in France, Auxerrois in Cahors) thrives at high altitudes where intense UV exposure triggers enhanced anthocyanin production and thicker skins. The variety was decimated by phylloxera in France but found ideal conditions in Argentina's Mendoza region. Its **early bud break creates frost vulnerability**, while **coulure** and **thin skins** (botrytis risk) present management challenges.

### Climate requirements—altitude advantage

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **GDD optimal** | 2,800-3,500°F (Region II-III) | Minimum: ~2,500 GDD |
| **GDD maximum** | ~4,000 GDD | Elevated pH concerns in hot climates |
| **Dormant frost tolerance** | -5°F to -10°F (-20 to -23°C) | Moderately cold-hardy |
| **Lethal cold** | Below -15°F (-26°C) | |
| **Spring frost** | **HIGH VULNERABILITY** | Early bud break |
| **Heat tolerance max** | ~95°F (35°C) | Phenolic biosynthesis declines above |

**Argentine high-altitude model**:
- **Optimal elevation**: 2,000-5,000 ft (600-1,500 m)
- **Premium elevations**: 3,600-5,400 ft (Uco Valley/Gualtallary)
- **Diurnal swing**: 30-40°F (15-20°C) ideal—maintains acidity while achieving ripeness
- **UV-B benefits**: Thicker skins, greater anthocyanins, higher polyphenols, enhanced aromatics

### Phenology data

| Stage | Timing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Bud break | Late March to mid-April | **EARLY**—frost vulnerable |
| Bloom | Late May to early June | 55-65 days from bud break |
| Veraison | Mid-late July | 45-55 days from bloom |
| Harvest | Mid-Sept to mid-Oct | **100-120 days from bloom** |

**Ripeness targets**: Brix 24-25° optimal (range 23-26°), seeds 75-100% brown, uniform deep purple-black color.

### Disease susceptibility matrix

| Disease | Rating | Critical notes |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Powdery mildew | MODERATE | Standard program required |
| Downy mildew | MODERATE-HIGH | Requires fungicides in humid climates |
| Botrytis | **HIGH** | **Thin skins** = highly susceptible |
| **Coulure** | **HIGH** | Major varietal weakness documented since 1892 |
| Phylloxera | **VERY HIGH** | Devastated French plantings 1875-1889 |

**Coulure details**: UC Davis (Hilgard 1892, 1896) documented "serious coulure at all experiment stations." Result: yields of 1-3 tons/acre in poor years vs 4-6 in good years. Clone selection critical—**FPS 08/12 shows improved fruit set**.

**Phylloxera history**: Did not adapt well to American rootstocks in France due to vigor imbalance. Argentina escaped phylloxera (dry climate, sandy soils)—own-rooted vines still common there.

### Vineyard management specifications

**Vigor**: MODERATE-HIGH with dense canopy requiring management.

| Parameter | Low-moderate vigor | High vigor |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Row width | 6-8 ft | 10-12 ft |
| Vine spacing | 4-6 ft | 6-8 ft |
| Vines/acre | 900-1,800 | 450-725 |

**Crop load targets**:
- Commercial premium: 3-5 tons/acre
- Commercial standard: 4-7 tons/acre (good set years)
- Small-scale: 8-12 lbs/vine

**Canopy management**: Leaf pulling CRITICAL—thin-skinned variety needs excellent airflow. Begin at fruit set, complete by veraison.

**Rootstock recommendations**:
- Moderate vigor sites: **101-14 Mgt, 3309C**
- High vigor soils: 3309C (counteracts excess growth)
- Drought: 110R, 1103P, 140Ru
- High pH/limestone: 41B, 420A
- Sandy/phylloxera-free: Own-rooted (Argentine tradition)
- **Avoid**: Very vigorous rootstocks (Richter 99, 1103P on fertile soils)

### Winemaking parameters—pH management essential

| Parameter | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Harvest Brix | 24-25° optimal | Range 23-26° |
| Harvest pH | **3.2-3.4** | Malbec tends HIGH pH |
| Harvest TA | 6.5-8.0 g/L | |
| Final wine pH | 3.55-3.65 | Target <3.50 pre-MLF |
| Fermentation temp | 75-85°F (24-29°C) | |
| Skin contact | 10-21 days | Extended: 21-30 for structure |
| Peak anthocyanin extraction | 3-5 days | |
| New oak % | 20-100% by style | |
| Barrel time | 6-24 months by style | |
| Aging potential | Basic: 2-5 yrs; Premium: 10-20+ yrs; Cahors: 10-25+ yrs |

**pH concern**: Malbec's naturally low malic acid = tendency toward high pH wines. UC Davis (Ough & Alley, 1966): "wines that underwent MLF suffered deficiency in acid, excessively high pH." Acidification often needed.

### Blending profile

**Contributes**: Excellent deep purple-black pigmentation, medium soft tannins, plum/dark berry/violet character, mid-palate weight.

| Region | Typical % | Style |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Bordeaux (modern) | 0-10% | Minor component |
| **Cahors (France)** | **Minimum 70%** | "Black wine" tradition |
| Argentine | 85-100% | Single varietal dominant |
| California Meritage | 5-15% | Color boost |

### Flavor profile by climate and altitude

| Climate/Altitude | Character |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Cool (Cahors) | Black plum, damson, leather, game, earth; higher tannin, firmer acidity; "Black wine" |
| Moderate | Blackberry, plum, black cherry, violet, cedar; balanced tannin/acid |
| Warm/High altitude (Argentina) | Ripe plum, blueberry, boysenberry; **violet** (signature), chocolate, sweet spice; plush soft tannins |
| Low altitude | Softer, riper, dark berry, less tannic |
| High altitude (3,500-5,000 ft) | More aromatic, fresh acidity, graphite/mineral, age-worthy |

**Signature aromatic**: **Violet/floral** (highly distinctive across all climates).

## Conclusion

These five Bordeaux varieties span a remarkable range of climate adaptability and winemaking potential. **Cabernet Franc** emerges as the most versatile for challenging climates, combining superior cold hardiness with earlier ripening than Cabernet Sauvignon. **Merlot** offers the quickest path to drinkable wine but demands vigilant disease management. **Cabernet Sauvignon** remains the benchmark for structure and longevity but requires the commitment of a full growing season. **Petit Verdot** rewards warm-climate growers with unmatched color and aromatic intensity, while **Malbec** delivers distinctive violet character and excellent pigmentation when protected from spring frost. Site-specific rootstock selection—particularly using low-vigor options like 101-14Mgt and 3309C—proves critical across all varieties to balance natural vigor against soil fertility and climate conditions.
