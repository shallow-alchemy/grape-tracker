# Pinot Noir and Chardonnay: Complete varietal profiles for vineyard management

These two Burgundy classics share early-ripening phenology, tight cluster architecture, and high disease susceptibility—but differ fundamentally in winemaking flexibility. **Pinot Noir** demands precise climate matching and meticulous viticulture yet rewards with transparent terroir expression; **Chardonnay** adapts to diverse conditions and winemaking styles, earning its reputation as the "winemaker's grape." Both thrive in Winkler Region I (1,500–2,500 GDD°F), require ~1,250–1,270 GDD (°C base 10) from budbreak to maturity, and need grafting to phylloxera-resistant rootstocks in most regions.

# PINOT NOIR VARIETAL PROFILE

## Climate requirements establish narrow optimal windows

**Growing Degree Days (GDD):**
| Threshold | Value (°C base 10) | Value (°F base 50) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Budbreak | 57 | 103 |
| Flowering | 334 | 601 |
| Veraison | 1,014 | 1,825 |
| Maturity | 1,251 | 2,252 |
| **Optimal Region** | Winkler I–II | 1,500–3,000 |

**Frost tolerance (LT50 values):**
| Growth Stage | Critical Temperature |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Mid-winter dormancy (maximum hardiness) | -20°C to -22°C (-4°F to -8°F) |
| Green swollen buds | -3.3°C (26°F) |
| Bud burst | -2.2°C (28°F) |
| Two-leaf stage | -1.7°C (29°F) |
| Four-leaf stage | -1.1°C (30°F) |

Classification: "Tender" category (0 to -8°F for 50% primary bud kill)—more cold-hardy than Merlot, less than Riesling (-15°F) or Concord (-21°F). Secondary buds survive colder temperatures than primaries, and tertiary buds are most tolerant.

**Heat and chill parameters:**
- Photosynthesis optimum: **77–86°F (25–30°C)**
- Heat shutdown temperature: **~95°F (35°C)**—vine metabolism slows significantly
- Extreme heat damage: Temperatures >104°F kill powdery mildew spores but stress vines severely
- Chill hour requirement: **800–1,200 hours** below 45°F (7°C)

## Phenology follows a 150–190 day growing season

| Stage | Timing | GDD Accumulation |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Budbreak | Late March–early May | 57 GDD₁₀ (103 GDD₅₀) |
| Bloom | Early June | 334 GDD₁₀ (601 GDD₅₀) |
| Bloom to veraison | 50–60 days | ~680 additional GDD₁₀ |
| Veraison | Late August | 1,014 GDD₁₀ |
| Harvest | September 13–30 (Oregon) | 1,251 GDD₁₀ |
| Total season | 150–190 days | — |

**Ripeness indicators:**
| Parameter | Target Range | Optimal |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Brix | 21–26° | 24–25° |
| pH | 3.2–3.6 | 3.35–3.45 |
| Titratable acidity | 4.9–8.6 g/L | 7.0 g/L |
| Seed color | Brown (green = bitter) | Fully brown |

Lag phase occurs ~55 days post-bloom when berries reach 50% final weight. Seed hardness serves as the primary lag phase indicator.

## Disease susceptibility demands intensive management

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery mildew | **HIGH** | 8–10 fungicide applications/season required |
| Downy mildew | **HIGH** | Major concern in humid climates |
| Botrytis bunch rot | **VERY HIGH** | Thin skins + tight clusters trap moisture |
| Sour rot | **HIGH** | Linked to compact cluster architecture |
| Eutypa | MODERATE | Trunk disease concern for mature vines |
| Phylloxera (own-rooted) | **VERY HIGH** | Grafting mandatory in infested areas |

**Structural vulnerabilities:** Pinot Noir's defining characteristics—thin skins, compact "pine cone" clusters, and small berries—create ideal conditions for fungal infection. The variety has no inherent resistance to powdery mildew, downy mildew, or phylloxera. Critical spray timing runs from 2 weeks pre-bloom through 4 weeks post-capfall; berry susceptibility effectively ends at 8% Brix, though sporulation continues to 15% Brix. Leaf removal and cluster thinning reduce rot pressure by improving air circulation through the fruit zone.

## Vineyard management requires significant labor investment

**Vigor and training:**
- Vigor classification: **Moderate to moderately high**
- Prone to excessive vegetative growth in fertile soils
- Primary training system: **Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP)** with Guyot pruning
- Cane pruning traditional in Oregon: 15–20 buds/vine
- Wire system: 8-wire typical (14 gauge, ribback anchor)

**Spacing recommendations:**
| Configuration | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Row spacing | 7–8 feet (2.1–2.4m) |
| Vine spacing | 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5m) |
| Vines per acre | 1,089–1,362 (standard) |
| High-density | up to 2,000+ (increases labor) |
| Oregon standard | 4' × 8' = 1,362 vines/acre |

**Crop load targets:**
| Scale | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Tons/acre (premium) | 2.0–3.0 |
| Tons/acre (standard) | 3.5–4.0 |
| Pounds/vine | 4–6 lbs |
| Clusters/vine | 20–30 (clone dependent) |
| Linear guideline | 1 lb fruit/linear foot of row |

**Labor requirements (per acre, full production):**
- Shoot positioning: 58+ hours
- Hedging (2 passes): 40+ hours
- Disbudding/sucker removal: 27 hours
- Total canopy work: **150+ hours/year**
- Custom harvest cost: $295–370/ton

## Clone selection profoundly affects wine character

| Clone | Characteristics | Best Use |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Pommard (UCD 4/5)** | Meaty, gamey, dark fruit, structured, high tannin, "cola" signature | Stand-alone foundation wine |
| **Wädenswil (2A)** | Cool-climate adapted, natural disease resistance, spicy | Oregon heritage, blending |
| **Dijon 115** | Most planted; balanced, complete, dark cherry, rose, leather | Backbone/"spine" for blends |
| **Dijon 667** | Red fruit energy, cranberry, fine tannins, Christmas spice | Blend structure, earlier ripening |
| **Dijon 777** | Dark, rich, intense color, pronounced tannins, cassis, spicy | Aging potential, stand-alone |
| **Dijon 114** | Early ripening, complex, perfumed | Cool sites |
| **828 ("Suitcase")** | Dense, structured, boysenberry, blackberry, high tannin | Adds depth/structure to blends |
| **Calera** | Brown spice (cinnamon, clove), cranberry | Character addition |
| **Mt. Eden (37)** | Small clusters, intense flavor, velvety tannins, deep color | Complexity |

Dijon 777 produces looser clusters than 115 or 667, reducing botrytis pressure in humid regions. Pommard and Wädenswil represent earlier California/Swiss imports; Dijon clones arrived in the 1980s–1990s.

## Rootstock selection balances vigor with site conditions

| Rootstock | Vigor | Best Conditions | Cold Tolerance |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **3309C** | Low-moderate | Deep moist soils | Good |
| **101-14 Mgt** | Moderate | Moist soils | Moderate |
| **Riparia Gloire** | Very low | High-vigor sites | Excellent |
| **Schwarzmann** | Low-moderate | Moderate sites | Moderate |
| **420A** | Low | High-vigor, high-K exclusion | Fair |
| **110R** | Moderate-high | Drought conditions | Fair |
| **1103P** | Moderate-high | Drought, varied soils | Fair |
| **SO4** | Moderate-high | Various; advances veraison | Fair |

**Critical notes:** Avoid Rupestris du Lot (causes coulure in small-clustered varieties). Avoid 3309C where nematodes present. 3309C is the most common rootstock in Oregon, promoting early ripening and showing lowest pruning weights in trials. Match low-vigor rootstocks (3309C, Riparia Gloire) with fertile, high-water sites.

## Blending traditions favor single-varietal expression

Traditional Burgundy law requires 100% Pinot Noir for red wines. Oregon mandates 90%+ for varietal labeling. In Champagne, Pinot Noir contributes **body, structure, richness, and red fruit character**, typically comprising 30–50% of cuvées; Blanc de Noirs uses 100% Pinot Noir. For sparkling wine, harvest earlier at **20–21°Brix** to preserve acidity.

Some California producers controversially blend small amounts of Syrah to add color and depth, though purists object.

## Flavor profiles shift dramatically with climate

**Cool climate (Burgundy, Oregon, New Zealand):**
- **Fruit:** Red cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, pomegranate
- **Secondary:** Rose petals, violet, tea, mushroom, forest floor, truffle
- **Structure:** High acidity, lighter body, silky tannins, mineral-driven
- Oregon signature: Distinctive "cherry-cola" note

**Moderate climate (coastal California, parts of Australia):**
- **Fruit:** Red and black cherry, raspberry transitioning darker
- **Secondary:** Subtle spice, herbs, light earthiness
- **Structure:** Medium body, balanced acidity, moderate tannins

**Warm climate (inland California, warmer sites):**
- **Fruit:** Black cherry, plum, blackberry, ripe raspberry
- **Secondary:** Vanilla, baking spices, cola, chocolate (oak-derived)
- **Structure:** Fuller body, lower acidity, softer tannins, higher alcohol (14–15%)
- Risk of overripe, "jammy" character

Thin skins universally produce low tannin regardless of climate—extraction technique matters more than temperature accumulation.

## Winemaking demands precision to preserve delicate character

**Harvest chemistry targets:**
| Parameter | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Brix | 24–25° | Higher = higher alcohol |
| pH | 3.35–3.45 | Critical for stability |
| TA | 6.5–8.0 g/L | — |
| YAN | 150–300 ppm | Supplement if <150 |

**Fermentation protocols:**
- **Cold soak:** 40–50°F (5–10°C) for 3–10 days pre-fermentation
- **Primary fermentation:** 75–90°F (24–32°C); peak ~85°F for extraction
- **Total maceration:** 10–25 days
- **Pressing:** At or near dryness (Brix 0); never above Brix 5
- **Cap management:** Punch down every 6–8 hours (3+ times daily)

**Whole cluster fermentation** adds spice, structure, and stem tannin. Range: 0–100%, typically 10–40% for measurable effect. Stems must be fully lignified (brown); green stems create harsh tannins. Traditional Burgundy producers often use 20–50%.

**MLF** is nearly universal for red Pinot Noir, increasing pH by 0.15–0.30 units. Post-MLF pH typically reaches 3.45–3.65.

**Oak treatment:** French oak preferred for subtlety. New oak percentage: 0–50% typical, 10–18 months barrel aging standard. Over-oaking easily masks Pinot Noir's delicate character—restraint essential.

## Small-scale growers face compounded challenges

Pinot Noir's reputation as "difficult" stems from multiple factors:

1. **Climate sensitivity:** Narrow optimal window; too cool = unripe green notes, too warm = flat and flabby
2. **Disease pressure:** Minimum 8–10 spray applications/season; cannot succeed organically in humid climates
3. **Thin skins:** Susceptible to rot, physical damage, birds, and insects
4. **Tight clusters:** Trap moisture, promote fungal infection
5. **Mutation tendency:** High clonal variability; wrong clone = poor results
6. **Transparency:** Flaws show clearly; the variety hides nothing
7. **Site specificity:** Expresses terroir extremely well—including poor terroir

**Home vineyard requirements:**
- Spray program mandatory (fungicide cost ~$400/acre/year)
- Bird netting essential
- Weekly disease scouting
- Establishment: 100+ hours labor in year 1
- Full production not reached until year 5; vine lifespan 25–35 years
- Air-blast sprayer, mower, hedger, leaf puller essential

# CHARDONNAY VARIETAL PROFILE

## Climate flexibility spans cool to warm regions

**Growing Degree Days (GDD):**
| Threshold | Value (°C base 10) | Value (°F base 50) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Budbreak | 50 | 90 |
| Flowering | 350 | 630 |
| Veraison | 1,068 | 1,922 |
| Maturity | 1,267 | 2,281 |
| **Optimal Range** | Region I–II | 1,700–3,000 |
| Maximum productive | — | up to 3,000 |

**Frost tolerance (LT50 values):**
| Condition | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mid-winter maximum hardiness | -7°F to -8°F (-22°C to -23°C) |
| Root LT50 | -5.9°C (21.4°F) |
| Root LT10 | -4.0°C |
| Root LT90 | -7.0°C |
| Budswell damage | 25°F (-4°C) |
| Post-budbreak green tissue | 28–32°F (-2 to 0°C) |

**Critical vulnerability:** Chardonnay is among the **first vinifera varieties to break bud** in spring, making it highly susceptible to late frost damage. Site selection avoiding frost pockets is essential.

**Heat and chill parameters:**
- Photosynthesis shutdown: **~95°F (35°C)**
- Heat damage threshold: Temperatures >104°F (40°C)
- Sunburn susceptibility: Moderate (bronzing of exposed berries in high heat)
- Chill hour requirement: **800–1,200 hours** below 45°F

## Phenology tracks slightly behind Pinot Noir to maturity

| Stage | Timing | GDD Accumulation |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Budbreak | Very early (7–10 days before Cabernet) | 75 GDD₁₀ (135 GDD₅₀) |
| Bloom | 10–14 day duration | 345 GDD₁₀ (620 GDD₅₀) |
| Veraison | 60–70 days post-bloom | 900–1,000 GDD₁₀ |
| Harvest | 100–120 days post-bloom | 1,267 GDD₁₀ |

**Regional harvest calendar:**
- Piedmont NC: Mid-late August
- Virginia: First week September (central/east)
- Champagne: September–October (sparkling base)

**Ripeness indicators:**
| Parameter | Sparkling | Table Wine | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Brix | 18–20° | 22–25° | >25° risks flat wine |
| pH | 2.9–3.1 | 3.0–3.3 | Rises 0.15–0.3 during fermentation |
| TA | 8–10 g/L | 6–9 g/L | Target 6.0 g/L finished |
| Seeds | — | Brown = mature | Green = bitter |

Cool bloom temperatures can cause millerandage ("shot berries")—irregular fruit set with many small, seedless berries.

## Disease profile mirrors Pinot Noir's vulnerabilities

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery mildew | **HIGH** | Specifically identified as particularly susceptible |
| Botrytis | **MODERATE-HIGH** | Mean severity 17–21% in trials; tight clusters contribute |
| Downy mildew | MODERATE | Standard V. vinifera susceptibility |
| Eutypa/Esca | MODERATE | Cold damage trunk splitting creates gateway for Crown Gall |
| Phylloxera (own-rooted) | **HIGH** | Grafting required |

**Disease management costs:** ~$369/acre/year in Central Coast California.

**Critical timing:** Powdery mildew spray period runs 2 weeks pre-bloom through 3–4 weeks post-bloom. Berries become substantially resistant 3–4 weeks post-bloom and virtually immune 6–8 weeks post-bloom. Botrytis critical sprays at flowering (E-L 25) and pre-bunch closure (E-L 31).

VSP training improves disease management. Early leaf removal (4–6 basal leaves) is critical for both powdery mildew and botrytis control.

## Vineyard management accommodates various vigor levels

**Vigor and training:**
- Vigor classification: **Moderate to vigorous**
- Pruning weight guideline: >0.4 lb cane prunings/foot of canopy = excessively vigorous
- Tendency to overcrop; crop adjustment often required
- Primary system: **Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP)**
- High vigor sites: Divided canopy systems (Open Lyre, Smart-Dyson, Geneva Double Curtain)

**Spacing recommendations:**
| Vigor Condition | Row Spacing | Vine Spacing |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Low-vigor rootstocks | — | 3–4 feet |
| Standard | 7–11 feet | 6–8 feet |
| High-vigor expected | — | 8–12 feet |
| Commercial example | 7' × 11' | 566 vines/acre |

**Crop load targets:**
| Scale | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Tons/acre (premium) | 3.0–4.0 |
| Tons/acre (standard) | 4.0–6.75 |
| Pounds/vine | 15–30 lbs |

**Canopy management:** Shoot thinning at 2–4 inches; leaf removal in fruit zone (4–6 basal leaves); summer hedging; cluster thinning if needed. Goal: Balance yield-to-pruning-weight ratio. Exposed fruit develops thicker cuticle, reducing mildew and botrytis.

## Clone selection spans French precision to California abundance

**Dijon Clones (French) – lower vigor, earlier ripening:**
| Clone | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **76** | Small berries/clusters, good structure, acidity, perfume; medium fertility |
| **95** | Full, rich, balanced; uniform fruit set in cool bloom; very good quality |
| **96** | Pear character, tropical notes; medium-high acidity; regular production |
| **548** | Highest ripeness/quality; lowest yield; slightly looser bunches; fastest ripening |
| **77/809** | Muscat/aromatic character; high linalool; orange blossom notes |
| **75, 78, 121, 124, 125, 277** | More vigorous, higher-yielding |

**California/Wente Selections – established producers:**
| Clone | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Old Wente** | Field selection; small clusters, lower yield; mineral character; "hens and chicks"; late ripening |
| **UCD 4** | High acid, high sugar, high yield; slower ripening warm regions; excellent for full MLF |
| **Wente/Rued** | 10–15% less TA than Clone 4; ideal cool climates |

**Climate matching:** Cool climates favor Dijon 76, 95, 96 for earlier ripening. Warm climates favor Clone 4 for acid retention. Multiple clones recommended for complexity.

## Rootstock selection follows similar patterns to Pinot Noir

| Rootstock | Vigor | Best Conditions | Nematode Resistance |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **3309C** | Low-moderate | Deep moist soils | Poor—avoid |
| **101-14 Mgt** | Moderate | Versatile | Moderate |
| **Schwarzmann** | Low-moderate | Waterlogging tolerant | Moderate |
| **420A** | Low | High density, alkaline | — |
| **SO4** | Moderate-vigorous | Wet soils | Moderate |
| **110R** | Moderate-high | Drought | Poor |
| **1103P** | Moderate-high | Drought | Fair |
| **Freedom, RS-3, RS-9** | Varies | Nematode areas | Excellent |

1103P may induce unexpectedly low vigor specifically with Chardonnay. 110R shows cosmetic scion overgrowth at the union. Avoid 140Ru—promotes coulure in small-clustered varieties.

## Blending roles extend from Champagne to Bordeaux blanc

**Single varietal:** Dominant use globally, with styles ranging from unoaked/stainless to heavily oaked with full MLF.

**Sparkling wine:** One of three permitted Champagne varieties. Blanc de Blancs = 100% Chardonnay. Harvest at **18–20°Brix** for higher acidity. Chardonnay contributes elegance, finesse, citrus, and chalky minerality to blends.

**Regional traditions:**
- Burgundy white: Single varietal
- Champagne: Blended with Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier
- Bordeaux white: Minor partner with Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon
- Australia: Sometimes blended with Sémillon

When blended, Chardonnay contributes body, weight, stone fruit notes, creamy texture (if MLF), and oak integration capability.

## Flavor profiles span the widest stylistic range of any white variety

**Cool climate (Chablis, Champagne, New Zealand):**
- **Aromatics:** Green apple, lemon, lime, grapefruit, wet flint, chalk, oyster shell
- **Structure:** High acidity, light-medium body, 12.5–13.5% ABV, lean/crisp mouthfeel

**Moderate climate (Burgundy Côte d'Or, Sonoma Coast):**
- **Aromatics:** Yellow apple, pear, stone fruits, citrus peel, hazelnut, brioche (with oak/MLF)
- **Structure:** Medium acidity and body, 13–14% ABV

**Warm climate (Napa, inland Australia):**
- **Aromatics:** Tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, passionfruit), ripe peach, melon
- **Structure:** Medium-low acidity, medium-full body, 13.5–14.5% ABV, rich/round mouthfeel

**The oak spectrum:**
| Style | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| **Unoaked (stainless)** | Primary fruit preserved, crisp acidity, lean/mineral, no MLF |
| **Lightly oaked** | Rounded mouthfeel, fruit still prominent, subtle texture |
| **Heavily oaked (new French)** | Vanilla, toast, clove, baking spices, buttery/creamy |
| **New American oak** | More aggressive vanilla, coconut notes |

## Winemaking offers maximum stylistic flexibility

**Fermentation temperatures by style:**
| Style | Temperature | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Crisp/aromatic | 50–55°F (10–13°C) | Preserves fruit esters |
| Standard white | 55–60°F (13–16°C) | Balance of fruit/complexity |
| Fuller style | 60–65°F (16–18°C) | More body development |
| Barrel fermented | 60–68°F (16–20°C) | Enhanced oak integration |

**Malolactic fermentation (MLF):**
- Full MLF creates buttery, creamy character (diacetyl) and raises pH 0.1–0.3 units
- Partial MLF (20–50% of wine) adds texture without losing acidity
- No MLF preserves crisp acidity and fruit-forward character
- Block with SO₂ (>25ppm free), low temps (50–57°F), or sterile filtration
- Full MLF works best with Clone 4 (higher acidity base)

**Oak treatment:**
| Type | Character |
|------|-----------|
| New French | Vanilla, spice, toast (0–40% of blend) |
| Used French | Subtle, oxidative (60–100%) |
| New American | Coconut, vanilla, aggressive |
| Toast: Light | Subtle wood, minimal flavor |
| Toast: Medium | Vanilla, spice, nuts |
| Toast: Medium+ | Caramel, toast |
| Toast: Heavy | Smoke, char, espresso |

**Sur lie aging:** 6–18 months on fine lees with bâtonnage (weekly to monthly stirring). Benefits: Creamy texture, flinty aroma, autolytic character (bread, brioche), enhanced SO₂ binding protection.

**Aging potential:**
- Unoaked/simple: 1–3 years
- Quality oaked: 3–8 years
- Premier/Grand Cru Burgundy: 10–20+ years

**Style technique summary:**
| Chablis/Crisp | Burgundian/Rich | California/Opulent |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Stainless fermentation | Barrel fermentation | High new oak (30–50%) |
| No MLF | Full MLF | Full MLF |
| No oak or neutral only | Sur lie with bâtonnage | Extended lees contact |
| Cool fermentation | 15–18 months barrel | Later harvest |
| Early bottling | 20–30% new oak | Warmer fermentation |

## Small-scale growing benefits from Chardonnay's adaptability

Chardonnay's reputation as the "winemaker's grape" and "blank canvas" reflects its malleability—it takes on the impression of site and technique more than asserting varietal character. This creates both opportunity (stylistic range) and challenge (requires intentional decisions).

**Site selection critical:** Early budbreak mandates avoiding frost pockets. Good air drainage essential; south-facing slopes in cooler areas; shelter from late spring frosts.

**Home vineyard expectations:**
| Year | Production |
|------|------------|
| 1–2 | Training, minimal fruit |
| 3 | 2–4 lbs/vine |
| 4+ | 8–15 lbs/vine (mature) |

Rule of thumb: ~15–20 lbs grapes per gallon of wine.

**Clone selection for small growers:**
- Dijon 76, 95, 96: Good for cooler areas, lower vigor
- Clone 4: Warmer sites, acid retention needed
- Multiple clones recommended for insurance and complexity

**Workload considerations:**
- Multiple spray passes required (disease-prone variety)
- Canopy management labor-intensive
- Weekly disease scouting essential
- Cannot skip sprays—tight clusters and high sugar content attract fungal infection

**Non-commercial production advantages:**
- Small batches allow experimentation (oaked vs. unoaked portions, partial vs. full MLF, different fermentation temperatures)
- Start with 20–50 vines to learn without overwhelming workload
- Basic equipment: Refractometer, pH meter, sulfur spray capability minimum
