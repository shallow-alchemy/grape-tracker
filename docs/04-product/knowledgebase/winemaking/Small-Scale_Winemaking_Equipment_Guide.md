# Small-Scale Winemaking Equipment Guide: 5-100 Gallon Operations

**This reference document provides comprehensive equipment guidance for small-scale winemakers processing 5-100 gallons per batch.** The guide covers essential vs optional equipment at each winemaking stage, budget recommendations by scale, cleaning and sanitation supplies, testing equipment, and practical advice on what to buy quality vs where to improvise. Equipment choices significantly impact wine quality, workflow efficiency, and long-term costs.

---

## 1. Equipment philosophy for small-scale winemaking

### Buy quality where it matters

**Invest in:**
- Fermentation vessels (you'll use them for decades)
- Corker (cheap hand corkers damage corks)
- pH meter (accuracy matters for SO₂ management)
- Hydrometer/refractometer (foundation of all measurements)

**Save money on:**
- Crushers (rent or borrow for annual use)
- Presses (rent until you're processing 100+ lbs annually)
- Bottle fillers (simple spring-tip works fine)
- Most hand tools (basic versions work)

### Scale considerations

| Batch Size | Typical Use Case | Equipment Investment |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 5-6 gallons | Kit wines, experimental batches | $150-400 |
| 15-30 gallons | Serious hobbyist from juice/grapes | $500-1,500 |
| 30-60 gallons | Dedicated home winemaker | $1,500-3,500 |
| 60-100 gallons | Semi-commercial/club scale | $3,000-8,000+ |

---

## 2. Crushing and destemming equipment

### Manual crushers

| Type | Capacity | Price Range | Best For |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Hand crank crusher | 1-2 tons/day | $200-400 | Small batches (<200 lbs) |
| Crusher-destemmer combo | 1-2 tons/day | $400-800 | Most home winemakers |

**Features to look for:**
- Stainless steel or food-grade nylon rollers
- Adjustable roller gap (for different grape sizes)
- Hopper size appropriate to your volume
- Easy disassembly for cleaning

### Motorized crushers

| Type | Capacity | Price Range | Best For |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Electric crusher | 2-4 tons/day | $800-1,500 | 500+ lbs annually |
| Electric crusher-destemmer | 2-4 tons/day | $1,200-2,500 | Efficiency-focused operations |

**When to upgrade:** If processing more than 300-400 lbs by hand becomes tedious, motorized equipment pays for itself in time savings.

### Rent vs buy decision

**Rent if:**
- Processing <200 lbs annually
- Still experimenting with grape sources
- Storage space is limited
- Local homebrew shop offers rentals ($25-75/day typical)

**Buy if:**
- Processing >300 lbs annually
- Consistent grape source secured
- Have storage space
- Plan to make wine for 5+ years

### Improvised alternatives

**For very small batches (<50 lbs):**
- Food-grade bucket + cleaned feet (traditional method)
- Wooden paddle/plunger crushing
- Hand destemming (tedious but effective)

6. **Variable capacity tanks**—worth the investment if you age wine seriously
7. **Sanitation supplies**—Star San and cleaning brushes are cheap insurance
