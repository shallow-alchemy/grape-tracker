## Stage 1: Crush

### Purpose and Chemistry
**Physical processes:** Cell rupture releases juice, pulp, and cellular contents. Pectolytic enzymes become active and begin breaking down cell walls. The process exposes juice to wild yeasts and bacteria present on grape surfaces.

**Chemical considerations:** Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) causes enzymatic browning when exposed to oxygen—the same enzyme responsible for apple browning. Immediate SO₂ addition inhibits this oxidation and controls wild microbial populations.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Target Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Temperature at crush** | <60°F (16°C) | Prevents spontaneous fermentation |
| **SO₂ addition** | 30-50 ppm (healthy fruit) | 75-100 ppm for compromised fruit |
| **Timing** | Same day as harvest | Within hours for mechanically harvested fruit |

**SO₂ dosing guide:**
- Clean, healthy fruit: 30-50 ppm
- Standard (most reds/whites): 40-50 ppm
- Compromised fruit (rot, mold): 75-100 ppm
- Planning MLF: ≤50 ppm
- Native yeast fermentation: 20-30 ppm or none

*Practical calculation: 1/4 teaspoon potassium metabisulfite per 5 gallons ≈ 45 ppm*

### Decision Points

**Destemming vs. Whole Cluster:**

| Factor | Destem | Whole Cluster |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Tannin profile | Softer, fruitier | More structural |
| Pinot Noir | Often partial (10-30% WC) | Traditional, adds complexity |
| Cabernet/Merlot | Almost always destem | Rarely used |
| Stem condition | Required if green | Only if brown/lignified |

**Crush intensity decisions:**
- Light/partial crush (50-80% berries broken): Burgundian style, promotes carbonic elements
- Standard crush: Breaks berries without shredding skins
- Over-crushing: Pulverizes skins/seeds, extracts harsh tannins—AVOID

### Wine Type Variations

**Red wines:** Crush and destem into fermentation vessel; skins remain with juice for maceration and fermentation; SO₂ at 30-50 ppm.

**White wines:** Crush (optional—can whole-cluster press); limited or no skin contact; press immediately or within hours; SO₂ at 50 ppm to prevent browning.

**Rosé wines:** Crush red grapes; brief skin contact (2-24 hours based on desired color); press when target color achieved; handle like white wine thereafter.

### Equipment (Small Scale)

| Equipment | Price Range | Capacity |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Manual crusher (rollers only) | $200-400 | ~500 lbs/hr |
| Manual crusher/destemmer | $400-600 | ~1,000 lbs/hr |
| Motorized crusher/destemmer | $1,200-2,500+ | ~3,000 lbs/hr |
| Food-grade bins (32-44 gal) | $30-75 each | Receiving must |

*Rental option: Many suppliers rent equipment for $25-50/day or crush grapes for ~$25/batch*

### Common Mistakes
1. Over-crushing creates harsh, bitter wines from shredded seeds
2. Failing to add SO₂ quickly enough allows oxidation
3. Unsanitized equipment introduces spoilage organisms
4. Processing too slowly—berry breakage during transport allows spoilage
5. Including green stems adds herbaceous character

### Measurement Targets at Crush

| Parameter | Red Wines | White Wines |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Brix** | 22-26° | 20-24° |
| **pH** | 3.2-3.6 | 3.0-3.3 |
| **TA** | 6-8 g/L | 6.5-8.5 g/L |
| **Temperature** | <60°F | <60°F |

---

## Stage 2: Pre-Fermentation

### Cold Soak (Reds) — Purpose and Chemistry

**What happens:** Aqueous extraction of color (anthocyanins) and flavor compounds occurs without alcohol present. Anthocyanins are water-soluble and extract preferentially over seed tannins (which are alcohol-soluble). The result is deeper color, rounder mouthfeel, and fruit-forward character.

**Key Parameters:**

| Parameter | Range | Optimal |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Temperature** | 35-60°F (2-16°C) | 45-55°F (7-13°C) |
| **Duration** | 2-10 days | 3-5 days typical |
| **SO₂** | 50-75 ppm | 50 ppm minimum |

*Research indicates maximum phenolic extraction occurs after 2-5 days; anthocyanins level off after ~3 days.*

**When to cold soak:** Recommended for Pinot Noir and lighter, color-shy reds. Optional for Cabernet and Merlot (already well-pigmented). Skip if temperature control unavailable.

### Cold Settle (Whites) — Purpose and Chemistry

**What happens:** Gravity settles suspended solids (pulp fragments, skin particles). This reduces PPO that causes browning and removes precursors to herbaceous aromas. Target solids: 0.5-1% v/v (50-250 NTU turbidity).

**Key Parameters:**

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| **Temperature** | 35-48°F (2-9°C) |
| **Duration** | 24-48 hours |
| **SO₂** | 50 ppm at press |
| **Target turbidity** | 50-250 NTU |

**CRITICAL:** Over-clarified juice may lack nutrients for healthy fermentation, causing stuck ferments.

### Pressing Timing for Whites

**Press BEFORE fermentation (standard):** Produces cleaner, more delicate wines with minimal phenolic extraction. Standard for aromatic whites (Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc).

**Process flow:** Crush → Optional brief skin contact (0-4 hrs) → Press → Cold settle → Ferment

**Pressing yields:**
- Free-run juice: 60-70% of total
- Press juice: 30-40% (higher pH, more phenolics)
- Keep separate initially; blend to taste later

### Enzyme and Nutrient Additions

**Pectolytic enzymes:** Add at crush for whites to improve press yield and accelerate cold settling (4-6 hours vs 24-48). Rate: 0.01-0.03 mL/L per manufacturer specifications.

**Nutrient timing:** Rehydration nutrients (Go-Ferm) prepared with yeast. Defer other nutrients to fermentation start.

### Equipment

**For Cold Soak (Reds):**
- Food-grade bins (32-44 gal)
- Chest freezer with temperature controller ($150-300)
- Ice bombs (frozen 2L bottles—swap every 10-12 hours)
- Dry ice (use food-grade, safety precautions required)

**For Cold Settle (Whites):**
- Stainless or food-grade plastic settling tanks
- Refrigerator/walk-in cooler
- Inert gas (CO₂, N₂, Argon) for blanketing
- Racking equipment

**Pressing Equipment:**

| Type | Price | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| Basket press (ratchet) | $150-400 | Small lots |
| Bladder press (Speidel) | $765-2,340 | Gentle extraction |

### Common Mistakes
1. Wild fermentation during cold soak from temperature >55°F or inadequate SO₂
2. Over-settling whites creates nutrient-deficient juice
3. Extended skin contact on delicate whites extracts too much phenolic
4. Not testing Brix, pH, TA before fermentation

### Measurement Targets Pre-Fermentation

| Parameter | White Wines | Red Wines |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Brix** | 20-24° | 22-26° |
| **pH** | 3.1-3.4 | 3.3-3.6 |
| **TA** | 6.5-8.5 g/L | 5.5-7.5 g/L |
| **SO₂** | 50 ppm | 30-50 ppm |
| **Temperature** | 35-48°F | 45-55°F |

---

## Stage 3: Primary Fermentation

### Purpose and Chemistry

**Sugar conversion equation:**
C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) → 2 C₂H₅OH (ethanol) + 2 CO₂ + Heat

Yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) converts fermentable sugars (glucose, fructose) into approximately equal parts ethanol and CO₂ by weight. Significant heat generation requires management.

**Conversion factor:** Brix × 0.55-0.65 = potential alcohol %

**Byproducts:** CO₂ (protective blanket), heat, aroma compounds (esters, higher alcohols), glycerol (adds body).

### Yeast Selection

**Commercial strains (recommended for reliability):**

| Yeast | Characteristics | Best For |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| RC212 | Good color extraction, smooth tannins | Pinot Noir, Burgundian reds |
| D254 | Full body, spicy notes | Cabernet, Syrah |
| BM45 | Color stable, high tannin tolerance | Bold reds |
| EC-1118 | High alcohol tolerance, reliable | Rescue yeast, sparkling |
| D47 | Enhances mouthfeel, floral | Chardonnay, whites |
| QA23 | Thiol release, tropical | Sauvignon Blanc |

**Inoculation rate:** 0.25-0.30 g/L (typically 1 g/gallon)

**Native/wild yeast considerations:**
- Higher risk: unpredictable outcomes, stuck fermentations possible
- Benefits: terroir expression, complexity
- Requirements: excellent fruit quality, experienced winemaker, lower SO₂ at crush
- Backup strategy: Start native, finish with inoculated yeast if needed

### Temperature Parameters

| Wine Type | Range | Optimal | Warnings |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Red wines** | 70-86°F (21-30°C) | 75-85°F (24-29°C) | >89°F risks stuck ferment |
| **White wines** | 45-60°F (7-16°C) | 50-59°F (10-15°C) | <50°F causes dormancy |
| **Rosé** | 55-65°F (13-18°C) | 60°F (16°C) | Balance extraction/freshness |

### Fermentation Duration

| Condition | Duration |
|-----------|----------|
| White wines (cool) | 2-4 weeks |
| Red wines (warm) | 5-14 days primary |
| Total maceration (reds) | 7-21+ days |
| Lag phase (no activity) | 24-48 hours |

**Healthy Brix drop rate:** Whites 1-3°/day; Reds 2-4°/day (no more than 4)

### Nutrient Management

**YAN Requirements by Starting Brix:**

| Starting Brix | Recommended YAN (mg/L) |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 21° | 120-150 |
| 22-24° | 150-200 |
| 25-26° | 200-250 |
| >26° | 250-300+ |

**Staggered Nutrient Protocol:**

| Timing | Product | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Rehydration | Go-Ferm | Vitamins, minerals |
| At inoculation | Fermaid-O | Organic nitrogen |
| 1/3 sugar depletion | DAP + Fermaid | Primary nitrogen boost |
| 2/3 sugar depletion | Fermaid-O only | Organic N (yeast stops using DAP) |

**DAP limit:** Maximum 0.96 g/L (legal limit)

**WARNING:** Adding DAP too early causes overvigorous fermentation → H₂S production → stuck fermentation

### Punch-Down/Pump-Over (Reds)

**Purpose:** Keep cap moist, homogenize temperature/sugar/yeast, extract color and tannin, prevent spoilage.

**Frequency:**

| Stage | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| Early fermentation | 3× daily |
| Peak fermentation | 2-3× daily |
| Late fermentation | 1-2× daily |

**Method comparison:** Punch-downs promote more seed tannin extraction; pump-overs better dissipate heat and provide gentler extraction.

### Fermentation Completion Indicators

**Complete when:**
- Brix reaches **-1.0 to -2.0** (hydrometer)
- Specific gravity reaches **<0.995** (ideally 0.990-0.995)
- Two consecutive readings 24-48 hours apart show no change
- Clinitest shows <0.5% residual sugar

**Stuck fermentation signs:**
- Brix stalls above 0
- No airlock activity but not at target
- Sulfur/rotten egg smell (H₂S)

**Stuck fermentation causes:** Temperature extremes, insufficient nutrients, high starting Brix (>28-30), pesticide residue, bacterial competition.

### Equipment

**Fermenters by volume:**

| Volume | Vessel | Price |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 5 gallon | Glass carboy | $30-50 |
| 5 gallon | PET carboy | $25-35 |
| 7.9 gallon | HDPE bucket | $15-25 |
| 20-32 gallon | Food-grade bins | $40-80 |
| 30-60 gallon | Variable capacity tanks | $400-800 |

**Essential accessories:**
- Hydrometer + cylinder ($15-25)
- Thermometer ($10-30)
- Airlocks + bungs ($2-5 each)
- Punch-down tool ($25-75)
- pH meter ($50-150)

### Common Mistakes
1. Temperature spikes after nutrient additions
2. Nutrient deficiency leading to H₂S
3. Adding DAP too early
4. Insufficient cap management
5. Bottling before confirming Brix is negative
6. Oxidation of whites from excessive oxygen exposure

### Measurement Targets

| Parameter | Start | End |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Brix** | 22-26° | -1.0 to -2.0° |
| **Specific Gravity** | 1.092-1.110 | <0.995 |
| **Temperature** | Per wine type | Return to 60-70°F |
| **pH** | 3.2-3.7 | May rise 0.1-0.2 |

---

## Stage 4: Press (Post-Fermentation for Reds)

### Purpose and Chemistry

Pressing separates wine from skins, seeds, and pulp after fermentation—the moment maceration and phenolic extraction ceases.

**Tannin extraction by pressure:**
- **Free-run wine** (gravity only): Highest quality, deeply colored, rich tannins
- **Low pressure (0.25 atm)**: First press fraction, can show coarse tannins
- **Medium pressure (0.3-1.0 atm)**: Often excellent quality, amplified intensity
- **High pressure (1.0-2.0 atm)**: Final extraction without seed crushing
- **Over-pressing:** Ruptures seeds, releases bitter "green-tasting" tannins—AVOID

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Target/Range |
|-----------|--------------|
| Press timing | 0° Brix (dry) standard |
| Early press option | 3-5° Brix for softer wines |
| Extended maceration | Days to weeks post-dryness |
| Free-run yield | 65-80% of total volume |
| Press wine yield | 10-35% (variety dependent) |

### Decision Points

**When to press:**
1. **By Brix:** Standard = 0° (hydrometer reads -1.5° to -2.0° due to alcohol)
2. **By taste:** When extracted tannins reach desired level
3. **By time:** Cap begins falling after fermentation completes (5-14 days)
4. **By variety:** Aggressive tannin varieties may benefit from earlier pressing

**How hard to press:** Press gently and incrementally. Stop when wine becomes thin, watery, or noticeably astringent. Taste is the primary guide.

### Wine Type Variations

| Wine Type | Pressing Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Red wines** | Press during or after fermentation |
| **White wines** | Press before fermentation |
| **Rosé** | Short skin contact (hours to 1 day), then press |

### Equipment

**Basket Press (Ratchet):**

| Size | Capacity | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| #25 (5 gal) | 50-60 lbs | $380-450 |
| #30 (8 gal) | 80-100 lbs | $450-550 |
| #40 (22 gal) | 150-200 lbs | $600-700 |
| #45 (45 gal) | 300-350 lbs | $800-890 |

**Bladder Press:**
- 20L Speidel: $765-850
- 40L Speidel: $900-1,100
- 80L Speidel: $1,200-1,500

**Bladder press advantages:** Uses water pressure, no manual cranking, more even pressing, gentler extraction, easier to clean.

### Press Fractions

- Standard practice: 85-90% free-run + 10-15% press wine
- High-tannin varieties: Separate multiple fractions; taste before blending
- Low-tannin varieties: Press wine often combined immediately
- Pinot Noir/hybrids: May need press wine for structure

### Common Mistakes
1. Over-pressing extracts harsh, bitter seed tannins
2. Oxidation during pressing (especially whites)
3. Pressing before fermentation completes (risk of stuck ferment)
4. Not tasting during pressing to find quality cut-off
5. Extended maceration without monitoring for spoilage

---

## Stage 5: Malolactic Fermentation (MLF)

### Purpose and Chemistry

MLF converts sharp L-malic acid ("green apple") to softer L-lactic acid via bacterial conversion:

**Effects:**
- Reduces titratable acidity by 1-3 g/L
- Raises pH by 0.1-0.3 units
- Produces diacetyl (buttery aroma)
- Creates small amounts of CO₂
- Provides microbiological stability

### Bacteria Options

**Commercial cultures (*Oenococcus oeni*):** Primary bacterium due to survival in harsh wine conditions. Available freeze-dried.

**Strain selection:**

| Condition | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| pH <3.3 | Acid-tolerant strain (e.g., CH35) |
| Alcohol >14.5% | Alcohol-tolerant strain; consider co-inoculation |
| pH >3.5 | Standard strain acceptable |
| High diacetyl desired | Malo-D or similar |

**Spontaneous MLF risks:** Undesirable bacteria may dominate; can produce biogenic amines, excess volatile acidity, off-flavors.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Favorable | Unfavorable |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Temperature** | 64-72°F (18-22°C) | <61°F or >77°F |
| **pH** | 3.3-3.5 | <3.1 (inhibitory) |
| **Total SO₂** | <30 mg/L | >40-50 mg/L |
| **Free SO₂** | 0 (undetectable) | Any detectable amount |
| **Alcohol** | <13% v/v | >14-15% v/v |

### SO₂ Considerations

Lactic acid bacteria are highly sensitive to molecular SO₂:
- **At crush:** Maximum 50 mg/L total if MLF planned
- **Before inoculation:** Should have 0 detectable free/molecular SO₂
- **After MLF completion:** Add 50 mg/L SO₂ immediately to stabilize

### Decision Points

**When to inoculate:**
- **Sequential (traditional):** After primary fermentation complete; higher risk due to high alcohol
- **Co-inoculation:** 18-24 hours after yeast inoculation; bacteria benefit from lower alcohol, warmer temps

**When MLF is complete:**
- Target: Malic acid <0.1 g/L (<100 mg/L for home winemakers)
- **CRITICAL:** As little as 30 mg/L can cause refermentation in bottle

### Testing Methods

**Paper chromatography:** Most common home method (~$50 kit); qualitative; detection limit ~100 mg/L. Process takes 8-24 hours.

**Enzymatic tests:** More precise; Accuvin strips (0-500 mg/L range) or Vinmetrica SC-55 MLF Analyzer.

**Sensory indicators:** Tiny CO₂ bubbles along vessel walls, softer/rounder acidity taste.

### Wine Type Variations

| Wine Type | MLF Approach |
|-----------|--------------|
| **All reds** | Standard; recommended for stability |
| **Buttery Chardonnay** | Full MLF for diacetyl |
| **Crisp whites** | Prevent MLF to preserve acidity |
| **Riesling, Gewürztraminer** | Avoid MLF |

### Co-Inoculation vs. Sequential

| Aspect | Co-Inoculation | Sequential |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Timing | 18-24 hrs after yeast | After dryness |
| Alcohol exposure | Lower (better) | Higher (stressful) |
| Duration | Shorter total | Can take 1-3 months |
| Diacetyl | Less | More potential |

### Equipment
- Chromatography kit ($40-80)
- pH meter
- SO₂ test kit
- Heating: Heat belts, seed heaters, warm room
- MLF nutrients (Opti-Malo, Acti-ML)

### Common Mistakes
1. Starting too cold (<60°F inhibits; <50°F stops)
2. High SO₂ blocking MLF (>40-50 ppm)
3. Bottling with residual malic acid—refermentation risk
4. Not testing for completion analytically
5. Racking during active MLF removes nutrients

### Measurement Targets

| Metric | Pre-MLF | Post-MLF |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Malic acid | 2-6 g/L | <0.1 g/L |
| pH | 3.1-3.5 | Rise 0.1-0.3 |
| TA | Starting level | Drop 1-3 g/L |
| SO₂ | <30 mg/L total | Add 50 mg/L |
| Duration | — | 1 week to 3+ months |

---

## Stage 6: Aging

### Purpose

**Flavor development:** Chemical reactions create secondary and tertiary aromas (vanilla, spice, leather, caramel).

**Tannin polymerization:** Short, harsh tannins link into longer, softer chains, improving mouthfeel.

**Micro-oxygenation:** Controlled oxygen exposure through barrel staves (0.5-2 mg O₂/L/month) softens tannins and stabilizes color.

### Vessel Options

| Vessel | Benefits | Limitations |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Glass carboys | Inert, easy to monitor | No oxygen exchange |
| PET carboys | Lightweight | Slight oxygen permeability |
| Small oak barrels | True micro-oxygenation + oak | Rapid extraction, maintenance required |
| Stainless steel | Inert, durable | No oxygen exchange |
| Oak alternatives | Cost-effective, controllable | No natural micro-oxygenation |

### Key Parameters

**Temperature:**
- Ideal: 55-65°F (13-18°C)
- Red wines: 55-60°F
- White wines: 50-55°F
- Stability more important than exact target

**Humidity (for barrels):** 60-70% relative humidity. Below 60% causes excessive evaporation; above 70% promotes mold.

**Duration by wine type:**

| Wine Style | Aging Duration |
|------------|----------------|
| Light whites | 0-6 months (stainless/glass) |
| Oaked Chardonnay | 6-12 months |
| Light reds | 6-12 months |
| Medium reds | 12-18 months |
| Full reds | 18-24+ months |

### Oak Influence

**Oak types:**

| Origin | Character | Relative Cost |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| French | Subtle, elegant, spice | 2-4× American |
| American | Stronger vanilla/coconut | Most economical |
| Hungarian | Between French/American | Moderate |

**Toast levels:**
- Light: More raw wood, coconut, vanilla
- Medium: Balanced vanilla, caramel, spice
- Medium+: Chocolate, coffee
- Heavy: Smoky, roasted

**New vs. neutral:**
- 1st use: 100% flavor contribution
- 2nd use: ~50% capacity
- 3rd use: ~25% capacity
- 4+ uses: Primarily for micro-oxygenation

### Oak Alternatives

| Product | Dosage | Contact Time |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Oak chips | 1-4 oz/gal | 1-4 weeks |
| Oak cubes | 1-2 oz/gal | 4-12 weeks |
| Oak spirals | 1 per 3-5 gal | 6-12 weeks |
| Oak staves | Per manufacturer | 2-6 months |

**Critical for small barrels:** One week per gallon of barrel capacity for new barrels. A 5-gallon new barrel requires weekly tasting.

### Equipment

| Item | Price Range |
|------|-------------|
| 5-6 gallon glass carboys | $30-70 |
| Small oak barrels (5-30 gal) | $100-600 |
| Oak alternatives | $5-30/batch |
| Silicone bungs | $3-8 |
| Thermometer/hygrometer | $15-30 |

### SO₂ Monitoring During Aging
- Target free SO₂: 25-35 ppm (reds); 35-50 ppm (whites)
- Check frequency: Every 4-6 weeks during barrel aging
- Maintain molecular SO₂: 0.5 ppm (reds), 0.8 ppm (whites)

### Common Mistakes
1. Over-oaking—taste weekly with small barrels
2. Insufficient topping (keep barrels within 1 inch of bung)
3. Temperature fluctuations cause pressure changes
4. Neglecting SO₂ monitoring

---

## Stage 7: Racking

### Purpose

Racking separates wine from sediment (lees), achieves progressive clarification, and provides controlled aeration (reds) or oxygen protection (whites).

### Types of Lees

**Gross lees:** Heavy sediment (dead yeast, pulp fragments, skin particles) forming within 5-7 days post-fermentation. Can produce off-flavors if wine sits too long.

**Fine lees:** Lighter sediment settling over weeks/months—primarily dead yeast cells. Can contribute positive mouthfeel (sur lie aging).

### Timing Parameters

**First rack:**

| Wine Type | Timing |
|-----------|--------|
| Red (from fermenter) | After pressing, settle 24-48 hrs |
| Red (after MLF) | Once MLF complete |
| White (pre-ferment) | After cold settling, before fermentation |
| White (post-ferment) | 2-3 days after completion |

**Subsequent racking schedule:**
- Traditional "3-3-3" rule: 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months, then every 3 months
- Bulk aging: Rack every 3-4 months with 20-40 ppm SO₂ addition
- Total: 2-4 rackings typical before bottling

### Aeration Decisions

**Splash racking (aeration):** For young reds, reducing H₂S/sulfides, first 6 months of wine's life. Promotes tannin polymerization and color stabilization.

**Protected racking:** For all whites, later rackings, wines near bottling. Tube submerged below surface; receiving vessel sparged with inert gas.

### Equipment

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Auto-siphon (standard) | $15-20 |
| Stainless racking cane | $20-35 |
| 1/2" food-grade tubing | $1-2/ft |
| Carboy/vessel stands | $20-35 |
| Wine pump (optional) | $100-300 |

### Common Mistakes
1. Disturbing lees by starting siphon too low
2. Excessive aeration for delicate wines
3. Not adding SO₂ at each racking
4. Racking during active MLF
5. Over-racking (>4-5 times) diminishes aromatics

---

## Stage 8: Fining and Filtering

### Purpose

**Clarification:** Remove haze-causing particles for visual brilliance.

**Stability:** Prevent post-bottling precipitates (protein, tartrate).

**Flavor modification:** Remove harsh tannins, off-flavors, or excess color.

### Fining Agents

**Protein-based (remove tannins/phenolics):**

| Agent | Dosage | Best For | Contact Time |
|-------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Egg whites | 1-2 per 5 gal | Softening red tannins | 1-2 weeks |
| Gelatin | 0.3-1.5 g/gal | Aggressive tannin removal | 1 week |
| Isinglass | 0.1-0.2 g/gal | Brilliant clarity (whites) | 2-4 weeks |

**Mineral-based (remove proteins):**

| Agent | Dosage | Best For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Bentonite | 0.5-2 g/gal | Protein stability (whites) |
| Kieselsol | Per manufacturer | Counter-fining |

### Filtering Options

| System | Price | Pore Size |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Gravity filters | $30-50 | 3-5 micron |
| Plate filters | $100-300 | 0.5-6 micron |
| Cartridge filters | $200-500 | 0.45-5 micron |

**Filtration levels:**
- Coarse (5-6 micron): Remove sediment
- Polish (2-3 micron): Visual clarity
- Sterile (0.45 micron): Remove yeast/bacteria

### Stabilization

**Cold stabilization (tartrate):**
- Chill wine to 28-32°F (-2 to 0°C) for 2-4 weeks
- Prevents potassium bitartrate crystal formation
- Primarily for whites and rosés

**Heat stabilization (protein):**
- Bentonite fining
- Test: Heat sample to 176°F for 2-6 hours; check for haze

### The Golden Rule: ALWAYS DO BENCH TRIALS

1. Measure 100 mL samples into labeled glasses
2. Add graduated doses (0.5×, 1×, 2× recommended)
3. Include untreated control
4. Allow contact time (1-7 days)
5. Select minimum effective dose

### Common Mistakes
1. Over-fining strips wine of body and color
2. Not doing bench trials
3. Filtering too early (clogs filters)
4. Using same bentonite dose every year (protein levels vary)

---

## Stage 9: Blending

### Purpose

**Achieving balance:** Correct acid, tannin, body, or aromatic deficiencies.

**Adding complexity:** Combine complementary characteristics.

**Improving structure:** Fill gaps in mouthfeel or finish.

### Parameters to Evaluate

| Parameter | Target Range | Calculation |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| pH | 3.3-3.6 (white), 3.5-3.7 (red) | Test final blend (non-linear) |
| TA | 6-8 g/L | Linear calculation |
| Alcohol | 12-15% | Pearson's Square |

**Note:** pH does NOT blend linearly—always test final blend.

### Press Wine Integration
- Free-run: Highest quality, most delicate
- Light press: Good structure, moderate tannins
- Hard press: Highest tannins, can be harsh
- Typically 5-15% press wine maximum for quality wines

### Bench Trial Setup
- Standard sample size: 100 mL
- Prepare graduated blends: 75/25, 50/50, 25/75
- Include 100% controls
- Allow 24 hours for integration before final evaluation

### Common Mistakes
1. Not doing bench trials—NEVER blend without testing
2. Blending flawed wines (flaws don't disappear)
3. Poor record-keeping
4. Palate fatigue—limit to 10-15 samples per session

## Stage 10: Bottling

### Pre-Bottling Checklist
1. ☐ Wine clear and stable
2. ☐ Heat stability confirmed (whites/rosés)
3. ☐ Cold stability confirmed
4. ☐ MLF complete (if applicable)
5. ☐ Final SO₂ adjustment
6. ☐ Equipment sanitized

### Key Parameters

**Target Free SO₂ at Bottling:**

| Wine Type | pH Range | Target Free SO₂ |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| White/Rosé | 3.0-3.3 | 25-35 ppm |
| White/Rosé | 3.3-3.5 | 35-45 ppm |
| Red | 3.4-3.6 | 25-35 ppm |
| Red | 3.6-3.8 | 30-40 ppm |

**Fill levels:** 10-15 mm headspace for cork closures.

### Closure Options

| Type | Best For | Aging Potential |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Natural cork | Age-worthy reds | 5-20+ years |
| Agglomerated | Medium-term | 2-5 years |
| Synthetic | Early drinking | 1-3 years |
| Screw caps | Freshness preservation | Varies |

### Equipment

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| Spring-tip filler | $8-15 |
| Double-lever hand corker | $20-30 |
| Portuguese floor corker | $60-90 |
| Italian floor corker | $150-200 |
| New bottles (case of 12) | $15-25 |
| #9 natural corks (100) | $15-30 |

**Recommendation:** Skip hand corkers; invest in floor corker immediately.

### Sweet Wine Bottling

For wines with >0.2% residual sugar:
- Sterile filtration (0.45 micron) required
- Add potassium sorbate (1 g/gal) + adequate SO₂
- Sorbate MUST be used with SO₂ to prevent geranium off-odor

### Common Mistakes
1. Oxidation during bottling—work quickly
2. Incorrect SO₂ levels
3. Contamination from unsanitized equipment
4. Poor cork quality
5. Bottling too early (wine not stable)

---

## Stage 11: Bottle Aging

### Purpose

**Further development:** Tannin softening, flavor integration, development of tertiary aromas (leather, earth, dried fruit).

**Color evolution:** Reds lighten, whites darken.

### Key Chemistry

**Reductive environment (limited oxygen):** Development of reduction notes possible; more common with screw caps and high-quality corks.

**Oxidative environment (more oxygen):** Faster evolution, risk of premature oxidation; common with poor corks.

### Storage Parameters

| Parameter | Ideal |
|-----------|-------|
| **Temperature** | 55°F (13°C) ± 5°F |
| **Humidity** | 60-70% RH |
| **Light** | Dark storage (UV damages wine) |
| **Position** | Horizontal (cork closures) |
| **Vibration** | Avoid |

**Critical:** Temperature stability more important than exact temperature. For every 10°C increase, aging reactions double in speed.

### Drink Windows by Wine Type

| Wine Type | Peak Window | Maximum Potential |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Light whites | 1-3 years | 3-5 years |
| Oaked Chardonnay | 2-5 years | 8-10 years |
| Rosé | 1-2 years | 3 years |
| Light reds | 1-3 years | 5 years |
| Pinot Noir | 3-10 years | 15-20 years |
| Cabernet Sauvignon | 5-15 years | 25-40+ years |

### Common Mistakes
1. Temperature fluctuations—more damaging than consistent warmth
2. Light exposure—even brief, repeated exposure causes damage
3. Storing upright (cork closures)—dries cork, leads to oxidation
4. Opening too early—wine needs integration time

### Bottle Shock

Temporary muting of aromas/flavors after bottling or transport. Duration: 2-4 weeks typical. Allow wine to rest before evaluating.

## Grape Type Considerations

### Vitis Vinifera (European Wine Grapes)

**Standard chemistry (baseline for all winemaking literature):**

| Parameter | Red Wines | White Wines |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Brix | 22-25° | 21-23° |
| pH | 3.2-3.6 | 3.0-3.3 |
| TA | 6-8 g/L | 6.5-8.5 g/L |

**Variety-specific handling:**
- **Pinot Noir:** Thin skins = lower tannin; requires careful extraction; cold soak enhances color; ferment warmer for color extraction; whole cluster option
- **Cabernet Sauvignon:** Thick skins = high tannin; always destem; ferment cooler to control tannin; benefits from extended oak aging

### French-American Hybrids

**Key differences from vinifera:**
- Higher acidity (10-15+ g/L vs. 6-8 g/L)
- Malic acid dominance
- Lower tannins, different anthocyanin structure
- Diglucoside anthocyanins = less color stability

**HIGH-ACID HYBRIDS (Marquette, Frontenac, La Crescent):**

| Variety | Typical Chemistry |
|---------|-------------------|
| Marquette | Brix 21-22°, pH 3.0-3.3, TA 9.5-10.5 g/L, very low tannin (~30 mg/L) |
| Frontenac | Brix 25°, pH 2.9, TA 15.4 g/L (high pH AND high TA simultaneously) |

**Deacidification strategies:**

| Agent | Dose | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Potassium Bicarbonate | 0.9 g/L per 1 g/L TA reduction | Small adjustments |
| Calcium Carbonate | 1 g/L per 1.5 g/L TA reduction | Large adjustments, pre-ferment only |
| Malic-reducing yeasts | — | 71B, Maurivin B (reduces malic up to 55%) |
| MLF | — | Essential for acid reduction |

**Tannin additions needed:** UVA'TAN at 500-600 mg/L AFTER pressing.

**Target final TA:** 6.5-7.5 g/L

### American/Labrusca Varieties (Concord, Niagara)

**"Foxy" character:** Caused by methyl anthranilate. Minimize by limiting skin contact.

**Key strategy:** Soak for color (2-10 hours), then PRESS before fermentation. Results in lighter color but reduced foxiness.

**Sugar additions usually required** (lower Brix at harvest).

### Muscadine Grapes

**Unique challenges:**
- Thick skins (40% of grape weight)
- Individual berry harvest (not clusters)
- Very low sugar, very high acid
- Different acid composition (tartaric + succinic, not malic)

**Processing:**
- Do not over-process (blender/food processor causes bitterness)
- Sugar additions almost always required
- Water additions for acid dilution
- Limited skin contact to prevent bitterness
- Best for sweet/dessert styles

## Winemaking Traditions and Approaches

### Conventional Winemaking
- Commercial yeast for reliability
- SO₂ management at all stages
- Temperature-controlled fermentation
- Fining and filtering as standard
- Lab analysis-driven decisions

### Natural/Low-Intervention Winemaking
- Native yeast fermentation (higher risk, more complexity)
- Minimal or no SO₂ (requires impeccable hygiene, short shelf life)
- Unfined/unfiltered
- Extended skin contact for whites (orange wines)

**When natural approaches work:** Pristine fruit, experienced winemaker, proper storage, sophisticated consumer.

**When intervention necessary:** Stuck fermentation, volatile acidity rising, spoilage detected, incomplete MLF before bottling.

### Old World vs. New World

| Factor | Old World | New World |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Alcohol | Lower (12-13.5%) | Higher (14-15.5%) |
| Acidity | Higher, crisp | Lower, softer |
| Oak | Large/old, subtle | Small/new, prominent |
| Fruit | Restrained, earthy | Bold, ripe |
| Focus | Terroir | Winemaker style |

### Key Traditional Decisions

**Whole cluster fermentation:**
- Best for Pinot Noir, Syrah
- Requires brown/lignified (ripe) stems
- Start conservative (25% whole cluster)
- Adds tannin, spice, complexity

**Native yeast:**
- Requires established vineyard, excellent fruit
- Have commercial yeast backup ready
- Can start native, finish inoculated
