# Sulfite Management for Small-Scale Winemaking: A Complete Guide

**This reference document provides comprehensive guidance on sulfur dioxide (SO₂) management for small-scale winemakers (5-100 gallon batches).** The guide covers SO₂ chemistry fundamentals, pH-dependent dosing tables, addition timing throughout winemaking, calculation methods, testing options, and common mistakes. Proper sulfite management is the single most important factor in producing stable, age-worthy wines that avoid spoilage and oxidation.

## 1. Understanding SO₂ chemistry

### The three forms of sulfite in wine

When potassium metabisulfite (KMBS) or any sulfite salt dissolves in wine, it exists in three forms that exist in pH-dependent equilibrium:

| Form | Chemical | Role | Proportion at Wine pH |
|------|----------|------|----------------------|
| **Molecular SO₂** | SO₂ | Active antimicrobial agent | 1-6% of free SO₂ |
| **Bisulfite** | HSO₃⁻ | Antioxidant, binds aldehydes | 94-99% of free SO₂ |
| **Sulfite** | SO₃²⁻ | Negligible at wine pH | <0.1% |

**Critical concept:** Molecular SO₂ is the only form that provides antimicrobial protection. You cannot measure molecular SO₂ directly—it must be calculated from free SO₂ and pH.

### Free vs bound vs total SO₂

| Term | Definition | Measurable? |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Free SO₂** | Sum of molecular + bisulfite + sulfite forms; actively protects wine | Yes |
| **Bound SO₂** | SO₂ that has reacted with wine components (acetaldehyde, sugars, anthocyanins); no longer protective | Indirectly |
| **Total SO₂** | Free + Bound; legal limit concerns | Yes |

**Binding partners** (in order of binding strength):
1. Acetaldehyde (strongest—nearly irreversible)
2. Pyruvic acid and α-ketoglutaric acid
3. Glucose and other sugars
4. Anthocyanins (red wine pigments—weak, reversible)

**Practical implication:** When you add SO₂, some immediately binds and becomes unavailable. Wines with more acetaldehyde, residual sugar, or color (reds) will bind more SO₂. Always test free SO₂ 24-48 hours after addition to verify actual levels.

## 2. Molecular SO₂ targets and pH relationships

### Why pH matters enormously

The percentage of free SO₂ that exists as protective molecular SO₂ drops dramatically as pH rises:

| pH | % of Free SO₂ as Molecular | Free SO₂ Needed for 0.8 mg/L Molecular |
|----|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 2.9 | 7.6% | 11 mg/L |
| 3.0 | 6.1% | 13 mg/L |
| 3.1 | 4.9% | 16 mg/L |
| 3.2 | 3.9% | 21 mg/L |
| 3.3 | 3.1% | 26 mg/L |
| 3.4 | 2.5% | 32 mg/L |
| 3.5 | 2.0% | 40 mg/L |
| 3.6 | 1.6% | 50 mg/L |
| 3.7 | 1.2% | 63 mg/L |
| 3.8 | 1.0% | 79 mg/L |
| 3.9 | 0.8% | 100 mg/L |
| 4.0 | 0.6% | 126 mg/L |

**The math:** Molecular SO₂ = Free SO₂ ÷ (1 + 10^(pH - 1.81))

**Critical insight:** A wine at pH 3.8 requires nearly **4× more free SO₂** than a wine at pH 3.4 to achieve the same antimicrobial protection. High-pH wines (above 3.6) become increasingly difficult to protect without detectable sulfite levels.

### Target molecular SO₂ levels

| Wine Type | Target Molecular SO₂ | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **White wines** | 0.8 mg/L | Standard antimicrobial protection |
| **Red wines** | 0.5 mg/L | Phenolics provide additional protection |
| **Rosé wines** | 0.6-0.8 mg/L | Intermediate protection |
| **Dessert wines** | 1.0-1.5 mg/L | Higher sugar requires more protection |
| **Post-MLF (any)** | 0.6-0.8 mg/L | Ensure bacterial stability |

**Sensory threshold:** Free SO₂ above 50 mg/L becomes detectable to sensitive tasters as a "burnt match" aroma. At pH 3.8+, achieving adequate molecular SO₂ while staying below sensory threshold becomes nearly impossible.

### Free SO₂ targets by pH and wine type

**White wines (target 0.8 mg/L molecular):**

| pH | Target Free SO₂ |
|----|-----------------|
| 3.0 | 13 mg/L |
| 3.2 | 21 mg/L |
| 3.4 | 32 mg/L |
| 3.6 | 50 mg/L |
| 3.8 | 79 mg/L |

**Red wines (target 0.5 mg/L molecular):**

| pH | Target Free SO₂ |
|----|-----------------|
| 3.2 | 13 mg/L |
| 3.4 | 20 mg/L |
| 3.6 | 31 mg/L |
| 3.8 | 50 mg/L |
| 4.0 | 79 mg/L |

**Important note on red wines:** Standard free SO₂ tests (Ripper, AO) overestimate free SO₂ in red wines by 30-60% due to anthocyanin-bisulfite binding that releases during acidification. The bound bisulfite is counted as "free" but is not actually available to protect the wine. Some researchers recommend targeting lower molecular SO₂ (0.2-0.3 mg/L) when using headspace methods that don't disrupt equilibria.

## 3. When to add SO₂: Timing throughout winemaking

### Addition schedule overview

| Stage | Typical Addition | Purpose |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Crush** | 30-50 mg/L (healthy fruit) | Suppress wild yeast, prevent oxidation |
| **Crush** | 50-75 mg/L (compromised fruit) | Higher dose for moldy/damaged grapes |
| **Post-fermentation** | Adjust to target | Protect finished wine |
| **Post-MLF** | 50-80 mg/L (one addition) | Prevent Brett, stabilize |
| **Each racking** | 10-25 mg/L | Compensate for losses |
| **Barrel aging** | Monthly check, adjust PRN | Maintain target free SO₂ |
| **Pre-bottling** | Adjust to target | Final protection |

### Stage-specific guidance

**At crush:**
- Add SO₂ before or immediately after crushing
- Dissolve KMBS in small amount of juice/water before adding
- Mix thoroughly—poor distribution leaves unprotected pockets
- Wait 6-12 hours before inoculating yeast (SO₂ dissipates)
- Higher doses (50-75 mg/L) for: botrytis-affected fruit, machine-harvested grapes, warm weather harvests, visible mold or damage

**During fermentation:**
- Do NOT add SO₂ during active fermentation
- Yeast produce 10-30 mg/L SO₂ naturally
- SO₂ additions stress yeast and can cause stuck fermentation
- Exception: Emergency addition to stop fermentation (100+ mg/L)

**Post-fermentation / Pre-MLF:**
- If MLF is planned: Keep SO₂ below 10 mg/L free (total below 30 mg/L)
- If no MLF planned: Add to target immediately after fermentation completes
- Timing is critical—the "Brett zone" between fermentation end and SO₂ addition is high-risk

**Post-MLF:**
- Add 50-80 mg/L in ONE addition once malic acid < 0.1 g/L
- Large single addition more effective than multiple small doses
- Goal: Establish microbial stability quickly
- Test free SO₂ in 48-72 hours; expect significant binding

**During aging:**
- Test free SO₂ every 4-6 weeks initially, then every 2-3 months
- Top additions of 10-25 mg/L to maintain target
- Expect 10-15 mg/L loss per racking from oxidation
- Barrels lose SO₂ faster than carboys/tanks (oxygen permeability)

**Pre-bottling:**
- Test 1-2 weeks before bottling
- Adjust to target free SO₂ for wine type and pH
- Allow 3-7 days for equilibration before final test
- Bottling with inadequate SO₂ is irreversible

## 4. Calculating SO₂ additions

### The fundamental conversion

**Potassium metabisulfite (KMBS) is 57% SO₂ by weight.**

This means when you add 1 gram of KMBS, only 0.57 grams (570 mg) actually becomes SO₂.

### Master formula for KMBS additions

```
Grams KMBS = (Desired ppm SO₂) × (Liters of wine) ÷ 570

Or for gallons:
Grams KMBS = (Desired ppm SO₂) × (Gallons) × 3.785 ÷ 570
```

**Simplified version:**
- 1 gram KMBS per gallon = 150 ppm SO₂
- 1 gram KMBS per 5 gallons = 30 ppm SO₂

### Quick reference: KMBS additions by volume

| Desired SO₂ | 5 Gallons | 6 Gallons | 10 Gallons | 15 Gallons | 30 Gallons | 60 Gallons |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 25 ppm | 0.83 g | 1.0 g | 1.7 g | 2.5 g | 5.0 g | 10.0 g |
| 30 ppm | 1.0 g | 1.2 g | 2.0 g | 3.0 g | 6.0 g | 12.0 g |
| 50 ppm | 1.7 g | 2.0 g | 3.3 g | 5.0 g | 10.0 g | 20.0 g |
| 75 ppm | 2.5 g | 3.0 g | 5.0 g | 7.5 g | 15.0 g | 30.0 g |
| 100 ppm | 3.3 g | 4.0 g | 6.7 g | 10.0 g | 20.0 g | 40.0 g |

### Campden tablet conversions

Standard Campden tablets contain **0.44 g potassium metabisulfite** (some brands use 0.55 g—check label).

| Campden Tablets | SO₂ Yield | Per Gallon | Per 5 Gallons |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 tablet (0.44g) | 250 mg SO₂ | 66 ppm | 13 ppm |
| 1 tablet (0.55g) | 314 mg SO₂ | 83 ppm | 17 ppm |

**Practical guidance:**
- 1 tablet per gallon is TOO MUCH (66 ppm per addition)
- 1 tablet per 5 gallons = ~13 ppm (reasonable maintenance dose)
- For 50 ppm to 5 gallons: use ~4 tablets or switch to powder

**Campden tablet limitations:** Difficult to measure partial tablets accurately. For precise additions, use KMBS powder with a scale.

### Stock solution method (recommended)

**10% KMBS solution preparation:**
1. Weigh 10 grams KMBS powder
2. Dissolve in ~50 mL warm water (dissolves poorly in cold)
3. Top up to 100 mL total with cool water
4. Store in sealed dark bottle (stable 2-3 months refrigerated)

**Using the 10% solution:**

| mL of 10% Solution | SO₂ Added per Gallon | SO₂ Added per 5 Gallons |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1 mL | 15 ppm | 3 ppm |
| 2 mL | 30 ppm | 6 ppm |
| 5 mL | 75 ppm | 15 ppm |
| 10 mL | 150 ppm | 30 ppm |
| 13 mL | — | 40 ppm |
| 17 mL | — | 50 ppm |

**Advantages of stock solution:**
- Easy to measure with graduated pipette or syringe
- Faster than weighing powder each time
- More accurate than crushing Campden tablets
- Allows quick, consistent additions

### 3% solution (alternative for very small batches)

Dissolve entire 4 oz (113 g) bag of KMBS in 1 gallon distilled water.

| mL of 3% Solution | SO₂ Added per Gallon |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 mL | 4.5 ppm |
| 5 mL | 22 ppm |
| 10 mL | 45 ppm |

## 5. Testing methods compared

### Method overview

| Method | Cost | Time | Accuracy | Red Wine? | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Aeration-Oxidation (AO)** | $100-300 setup | 15-20 min | ±2 mg/L | Yes (with caveats) | Gold standard; serious hobbyists |
| **Ripper titration (starch)** | $30-50 | 5 min | ±5 mg/L | Difficult | Budget option; whites only |
| **Vinmetrica SC-100/300** | $200-400 | 5 min | ±3-5 mg/L | Yes | Best home winemaker option |
| **Hanna autotitrator** | $300-500 | 5 min | ±3-5 mg/L | Yes | Automated convenience |
| **Titrets** | $2-3/test | 2 min | ±5 mg/L | No | Quick checks; whites only |
| **Accuvin test strips** | $1-2/test | 5 min | ±10 mg/L | Limited | Very rough estimates only |

### Aeration-oxidation (AO) method

**How it works:** Wine is acidified, then air bubbles strip molecular SO₂ (now gaseous) into a hydrogen peroxide trap, where it oxidizes to sulfuric acid. The acid is titrated with NaOH.

**Pros:**
- Most accurate method
- Not affected by phenolics or ascorbic acid
- Industry reference standard

**Cons:**
- Requires elaborate glassware setup
- 15-20 minutes per test
- NaOH solution degrades (must standardize regularly)
- Still overestimates free SO₂ in red wines (releases weakly-bound bisulfite)

**Home setup cost:** ~$100-150 for simplified home apparatus

### Ripper titration methods

**How it works:** Acidified wine is titrated with iodine solution. Iodine reacts with bisulfite until all is consumed, then free iodine appears (endpoint).

**Traditional Ripper (starch indicator):**
- Starch turns blue-black with free iodine
- Endpoint difficult to see in red wines
- Accuracy: ±5 ppm
- Cost: ~$30-50 for supplies

**Vinmetrica SC-100/SC-300:**
- Uses amperometric probe to detect iodine (no color needed)
- Works in red wines
- Accuracy: ±3-5 ppm (comparable to AO)
- SC-100: SO₂ only (~$200)
- SC-300: SO₂ + pH/TA (~$350-400)

**Hanna HI84500:**
- Automated titration with ORP electrode
- Detects endpoint electronically
- More automated but less precise than Vinmetrica in some studies
- Cost: ~$300-500

### Recommendations by winemaker level

**Beginner (first few batches):**
- Use calculated additions based on pH
- Test with Titrets or Accuvin strips for rough verification
- Focus on consistent addition schedule

**Intermediate (regular winemaking):**
- Invest in Vinmetrica SC-100 or SC-300
- Test before each major addition
- Track SO₂ levels in a log

**Advanced (quality-focused):**
- AO apparatus for verification
- Vinmetrica for routine monitoring
- Consider headspace methods for red wines
- Send samples to commercial lab annually for calibration check

## 6. The red wine measurement problem

### Why standard tests overestimate free SO₂ in reds

Anthocyanins (red wine pigments) loosely bind bisulfite. During testing:
1. Sample is acidified (required for both AO and Ripper)
2. Acidification breaks anthocyanin-bisulfite bonds
3. Released bisulfite is counted as "free"
4. But in the wine, that bisulfite was bound and NOT protecting

**Magnitude of error:** Studies show standard methods report 30-60% higher free SO₂ than actually available in red wines.

### Practical implications

**Option 1: Accept the limitation**
- Use standard methods knowing you're overestimating
- Maintain slightly higher "measured" free SO₂ targets for reds
- Focus on preventing problems (good sanitation, complete fermentation, prompt MLF)

**Option 2: Target lower molecular SO₂ for reds**
- Some researchers suggest 0.2-0.3 mg/L molecular when using headspace methods
- Standard methods would show higher values at these true levels

**Option 3: Send red wines to commercial lab**
- Labs using headspace or non-acidifying methods give truer readings
- Useful for calibrating your home measurements

### Why reds survive with less protection

Red wines are inherently more stable due to:
- Phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity
- Tannins that bind acetaldehyde
- Generally complete dryness (no residual sugar for Brett)
- Lower pH in many red styles

This is why 0.5 mg/L molecular target is standard for reds vs 0.8 mg/L for whites.

## 7. Common mistakes and troubleshooting

### Addition errors

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Adding SO₂ during fermentation | Stressed/stuck yeast | Wait until fermentation complete |
| Not dissolving before adding | Uneven distribution; hotspots | Always dissolve in water/wine first |
| Adding to headspace | Gas escapes; minimal protection | Add to liquid, stir gently |
| 1 Campden per gallon | 66 ppm per dose; cumulative excess | Use 1 per 5 gallons for maintenance |
| Not accounting for binding | Lower actual protection than expected | Test 48 hours post-addition |

### Measurement errors

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Old/degraded reagents | Inaccurate readings | Replace iodine solution regularly; standardize NaOH |
| Skipping calibration | Systematic over/underestimate | Run known standards periodically |
| Testing immediately after addition | SO₂ not equilibrated | Wait 24-48 hours before testing |
| Ignoring pH | Wrong free SO₂ target | Always calculate based on pH |

### Storage and handling errors

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Old KMBS powder | Reduced potency (loses ~10%/year) | Buy fresh annually; store sealed/cool |
| Open container of KMBS | Absorbs moisture; degrades | Keep tightly sealed; use desiccant |
| Stock solution too old | Degraded; inaccurate additions | Remake every 2-3 months |
| Not recording additions | Unknown cumulative total | Log every addition with date/amount |

### Symptom-based troubleshooting

**Wine smells like burnt match / sulfur:**
- Cause: Free SO₂ too high (>50 mg/L) or recent large addition
- Fix: Splash rack to dissipate; time often resolves
- Prevention: Test and add incrementally; don't over-sulfite

**Wine developing VA (vinegar) despite SO₂ additions:**
- Cause: Acetobacter contamination before SO₂ established; inadequate molecular SO₂
- Check: Verify pH and recalculate molecular SO₂; may need higher free target
- Prevention: Add SO₂ promptly post-fermentation; minimize oxygen exposure

**Wine turning brown despite SO₂:**
- Cause: Bound SO₂ not protecting; oxidation faster than protection
- Check: Test free SO₂ (may be mostly bound)
- Fix: Add fresh SO₂; consider ascorbic acid (25-50 mg/L) with SO₂
- Prevention: More frequent testing and maintenance

**MLF won't start:**
- Cause: SO₂ too high; molecular SO₂ inhibiting bacteria
- Check: Total SO₂ should be <30 mg/L for MLF
- Fix: Wait (SO₂ will bind/dissipate); rack with some aeration
- Prevention: Don't add SO₂ until MLF complete if MLF is planned

## 8. Legal limits and labeling

### US TTB limits (table wine)

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Total SO₂ | 350 mg/L (ppm) maximum |
| "Contains Sulfites" label | Required if >10 mg/L total |

### Practical ceiling

While 350 mg/L is legal, well-made wines rarely exceed:
- Dry wines: 50-150 mg/L total
- Sweet wines: 150-250 mg/L total

High total SO₂ indicates either excessive additions or high binding (often from acetaldehyde production during oxidation—a sign of handling problems).

### Natural/low-intervention considerations

"No added sulfite" wines still contain 10-30 mg/L from yeast metabolism. True "sulfite-free" is chemically impossible in wine.

---

## 9. Quick reference tables

### Molecular SO₂ calculator

**Formula:** Molecular SO₂ = Free SO₂ ÷ (1 + 10^(pH - 1.81))

**To find target Free SO₂:**
Free SO₂ = Target Molecular SO₂ × (1 + 10^(pH - 1.81))

### Addition quick reference (KMBS powder)

| Volume | 25 ppm | 50 ppm | 75 ppm |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 gallon | 0.17 g | 0.33 g | 0.50 g |
| 5 gallons | 0.83 g | 1.67 g | 2.50 g |
| 6 gallons | 1.0 g | 2.0 g | 3.0 g |
| 10 gallons | 1.67 g | 3.33 g | 5.0 g |
| 15 gallons | 2.50 g | 5.0 g | 7.5 g |
| 30 gallons | 5.0 g | 10.0 g | 15.0 g |

**Teaspoon approximation:** ¼ teaspoon KMBS ≈ 1.5 g ≈ 45 ppm in 5 gallons

### Target free SO₂ by pH (0.8 mg/L molecular for whites)

| pH | Free SO₂ Target |
|----|-----------------|
| 3.0 | 13 mg/L |
| 3.1 | 16 mg/L |
| 3.2 | 21 mg/L |
| 3.3 | 26 mg/L |
| 3.4 | 32 mg/L |
| 3.5 | 40 mg/L |
| 3.6 | 50 mg/L |
| 3.7 | 63 mg/L |
| 3.8 | 79 mg/L |

### Testing equipment summary

| Test Type | Product | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|---------|------|-------|
| Best value | Vinmetrica SC-100 | ~$200 | SO₂ only; works for reds |
| Complete kit | Vinmetrica SC-300 | ~$350 | SO₂ + pH/TA |
| Budget | Titrets | ~$25/10 tests | Whites only |
| Gold standard | AO apparatus | ~$100-150 | Most accurate; more time |

## Key takeaways

1. **Molecular SO₂ is what matters**—free SO₂ targets must be calculated from pH
2. **pH is everything**—a pH 3.8 wine needs 4× more free SO₂ than pH 3.4
3. **Add promptly post-fermentation**—the "Brett zone" is dangerous
4. **Test, don't guess**—especially for aging wines
5. **One large post-MLF addition** is more effective than multiple small doses
6. **Binding happens**—always verify free SO₂ 48 hours after addition
7. **Red wine measurements lie**—standard tests overestimate by 30-60%
8. **Stock solutions save time**—make 10% KMBS solution for easy additions
9. **Record everything**—track additions and test results in a log
