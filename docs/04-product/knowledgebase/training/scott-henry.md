The Scott-Henry system can increase yields by **50% over VSP** while maintaining fruit quality, making it one of the most practical upgrades available to small-scale growers struggling with excessive vine vigor. Developed by Oregon aerospace engineer Calvin Scott Henry III in 1982, this vertically divided canopy system trains shoots both upward and downward from two fruiting zones positioned at mid-height, effectively doubling canopy surface area per foot of row. For backyard growers with 10-100 vines on fertile soil—especially those fighting dense canopies, disease pressure, and repeated hedging passes—Scott-Henry offers a relatively simple conversion path from existing VSP trellises by adding just one additional wire.

The system works by splitting what would otherwise be an overcrowded single canopy into two distinct curtains: an upper tier trained upward like traditional VSP, and a lower tier trained downward using a moveable foliage wire. This division exposes fruit clusters to better air circulation and sunlight while allowing the vine to support more productive shoots without the shading problems that plague high-vigor VSP installations.

## How Scott-Henry differs from other training systems

Understanding when Scott-Henry makes sense requires comparing it directly to the two systems it most commonly replaces or competes with: Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP) and Geneva Double Curtain (GDC).

**VSP** uses a single fruiting wire with shoots trained exclusively upward between catch wires, creating one canopy wall. This works beautifully on low-to-moderate vigor sites but creates problems when vines push excessive growth—dense, shaded interiors promote Botrytis and powdery mildew, require multiple hedging passes, and leave fruit clusters buried in leaf layers. Scott-Henry directly addresses these issues by vertically splitting the canopy, training half the shoots downward to create a "mirror image" below the upward-growing portion.

**Geneva Double Curtain** also divides the canopy but does so horizontally rather than vertically, creating two pendant curtains positioned 3-4 feet apart across the row. GDC uses spur pruning on permanent cordons and generally requires wider row spacing (minimum 10 feet) to accommodate its horizontal spread. Originally developed in Geneva, New York for vigorous American varieties like Concord, GDC favors varieties with trailing growth habits.

Scott-Henry occupies a middle ground: it provides divided canopy benefits within standard row spacing, uses cane pruning for easier shoot separation, and suits varieties with more upright growth characteristics. The practical advantage for small growers converting existing VSP is significant—Scott-Henry requires only adding one fruiting wire at about **6 inches below the existing wire**, plus a moveable foliage wire, versus GDC's complete trellis reconfiguration.

Wisconsin's 6-year research trial demonstrated the yield difference clearly: Frontenac vines on Scott-Henry produced **30 pounds per vine (8.7 tons/acre)** compared to 16 pounds per vine (4.7 tons/acre) on VSP. Marquette showed similar results at 17 versus 10 pounds per vine. Critically, researchers found no significant difference in sugar or acid composition at harvest between systems—the quality stayed consistent despite the substantially higher yields.

## When to choose Scott-Henry over simpler systems

Scott-Henry excels on high-vigor sites where VSP creates management headaches. The system is appropriate when vines produce excessive vegetative growth, when dense canopies require multiple hedging passes per season, when disease pressure from Botrytis or powdery mildew remains problematic despite standard spray programs, or when fertile soils with abundant rainfall drive vigor beyond what single-canopy systems can manage effectively.

The key threshold for deciding between VSP and Scott-Henry involves pruning weights. Research indicates that divided canopy systems show no benefit for vines producing less than **0.7 kg of cane prunings per meter of row**. If your dormant pruning yields substantial wood—consistently heavy canes with dense growth—Scott-Henry likely makes sense. If pruning produces modest, pencil-diameter canes with moderate density, VSP remains appropriate.

Specific conditions favoring Scott-Henry include high water tables, waterlogged soils, sites with excessive nitrogen, and older vineyards where accumulated soil fertility drives persistent vigor problems. Oregon growers report particular success using Scott-Henry on sites with "too much vigor, too much green growth" that overwhelms VSP management.

Stay with VSP when working with low-nutrient soils, limited irrigation or rainfall, low-vigor varieties, or sites that naturally produce balanced vines without extensive canopy management. Converting low-vigor vines to Scott-Henry adds complexity without benefit and may actually harm vine health by spreading insufficient energy across too large a canopy structure.

## Advantages and limitations for small-scale growers

For small plantings of 10-100 vines, Scott-Henry offers compelling practical advantages beyond the headline yield improvements. Conversion from existing VSP costs relatively little—adding one wire runs approximately **5-10% above VSP trellis costs** rather than requiring complete infrastructure replacement. Disease pressure typically drops due to the naturally open canopy, potentially reducing spray frequency and improving cluster sanitation. Hedging requirements decrease substantially because the divided canopy absorbs vigor that would otherwise require repeated mechanical or hand trimming.

The University of Wisconsin research found that vigorous cultivars like Marquette and La Crescent required "no to minimal hedging to control shoot growth" on Scott-Henry, whereas VSP installations of the same varieties needed multiple hedging passes. For small-scale growers performing hedging by hand, this labor reduction often offsets the additional shoot-positioning work Scott-Henry requires.

The primary limitation involves timing-critical shoot training during a narrow window around bloom. Shoots from the lower tier must be separated and "flicked" downward precisely when flowering begins but before tendrils attach—typically a window of just several days. Miss this timing and subsequent correction requires substantial hand labor. As one Cornell consultant noted: "If you don't get them ahead of time, or you do it too soon, you create a lot of hand labor."

Additional considerations include a learning curve for mastering the timing and technique of shoot separation, the unsuitability of Scott-Henry for low-vigor sites or varieties, and slightly increased overall shoot-positioning time (approximately **25% more than VSP**, translating to 15-20 hours per acre versus 12-16 hours for VSP).

## Infrastructure requirements for small plantings

Scott-Henry trellis construction builds on standard VSP infrastructure with modest additions. The critical difference lies in having two fruiting wires rather than one, plus a moveable foliage wire system for training shoots downward.

**Post specifications** follow standard viticulture practice. End posts should be 5-6 inches in diameter and 9-10 feet long, with 6 feet visible above ground and 3-4 feet buried. Use earth anchors for rows up to 600 feet; rows exceeding this length require H-brace end post systems. Line posts of 3-4 inch diameter and 8-9 feet length should be spaced 21-28 feet apart depending on soil conditions and wire tension requirements, with 2-3 feet of burial depth.

**Wire configuration** requires a minimum of 5-7 wires total. The lower fruiting wire sits at approximately **40 inches (102 cm)** from ground level, with the upper fruiting wire positioned at **46 inches (117 cm)**—maintaining a crucial **6-inch gap** between them. This gap provides the air circulation and light penetration essential for disease management and fruit quality. Above the upper fruiting wire, standard catch wires space approximately 12 inches apart for upward shoot positioning, reaching a total trellis height of 60-70 inches. 

The moveable foliage wire represents Scott-Henry's distinctive feature. During winter and early spring, this wire rests at approximately the same height as the upper fruiting wire. At early flowering, it gets placed on top of shoots from the lower canes to hold them horizontally. Then at early fruit set, the wire moves downward and attaches to posts approximately **30 inches (76 cm)** below the fruiting zone, training shoots into their final downward orientation.

**Wire gauge** should match VSP specifications: 12-12.5 gauge high-tensile galvanized steel for fruiting wires (which bear fruit load) and 12.5-14 gauge for catch wires. Using the same gauge for the moveable foliage wire as catch wires works adequately since it primarily guides shoots rather than supporting significant weight.

**Cost estimates for small plantings** scale from VSP baseline costs. Material costs for VSP trellis construction (posts, wire, anchors, hardware) run approximately **$1,500-$2,500 per acre** for materials alone, with total installation costs ranging from $6,500-$7,700 per acre including labor. Scott-Henry adds roughly $150-$300 per acre in additional wire and clip costs for small plantings. For a backyard installation of 25 vines, expect approximately $200-$400 in additional materials above a basic VSP trellis—primarily one roll of 12.5 gauge wire ($30-$60 for 4,000 feet) plus clips and hardware.

The economic case for Scott-Henry on small plantings often comes down to labor rather than materials. The modest material investment returns through reduced hedging labor, decreased disease management requirements, and substantially increased yields—potentially paying for conversion costs within the first productive season.

## Vine spacing and shoot density targets

Scott-Henry accommodates standard row widths of **9-10 feet** between rows, making it compatible with most vineyard equipment and allowing conversion from existing VSP without row reconfiguration. In-row vine spacing should be **5-6 feet for vinifera varieties** and **6-8 feet for American cultivars and vigorous hybrids**, providing adequate room for the expanded canopy surface area.

The target shoot density of approximately **5 shoots per foot of canopy length** applies to each tier independently. Since Scott-Henry creates two canopy surfaces from each linear foot of row, total shoot capacity roughly doubles compared to VSP. For balanced cropping with cane-pruned Scott-Henry, this translates to **2.5 two-bud spurs equivalent per foot of canopy** or approximately **14 buds retained per pound of pruning weight** as a balanced pruning guideline.

## Establishment procedures over three years

The establishment timeline for Scott-Henry parallels single-canopy systems through the first year, then diverges as the two-tier structure develops in years two and three.

**Year one** focuses exclusively on root system and trunk development regardless of final training system. Plant dormant bare-root or potted vines in early spring as soon as soil conditions permit. Install rolled steel or rebar training stakes—never bamboo or string, which lack sufficient rigidity for proper trunk development. At planting, prune vines to two buds. Allow shoots to develop naturally, then select the 2-3 strongest for training to the stake. Remove all flower clusters during year one; the vine cannot support fruit production while establishing its root system and trunk structure. If the strongest shoot doesn't reach the desired head height of approximately 30 inches by late fall, prune back to 3-4 buds in winter and retrain the strongest shoot the following season.

**Year two** establishes the framework for Scott-Henry's distinctive two-tier structure. If the trunk reached wire height during year one, make the dormant pruning cut at a node 3-4 inches above the lower fruiting wire. During the growing season, select two shoots growing from 2-6 inches below the lower training wire and train these along the lower wire, one on each side of the trunk—these become the lower tier's fruiting canes for year three. Simultaneously, train four additional shoots near the head of the vine upward toward the upper wire position; these provide options for upper tier fruiting canes. Remove all other shoots while still small to direct vine energy into the framework structure. Continue removing all fruit clusters at bloom—the vine remains too young for productive cropping.

At the end of year two, dormant pruning establishes the initial fruiting structure. Select the best canes from both the lower wire candidates and the upward-trained shoots near the head. Prune back the selected canes to 7-10 buds each, providing approximately 14-20 total buds per plant. This moderate bud count allows initial crop production while the vine continues establishment.

**Year three** completes the two-tier structure and produces the first meaningful fruit. Select four canes total: two trained along the lower fruiting wire (approximately 40 inches) and two along the upper fruiting wire (approximately 46 inches). Position canes on opposite sides of the post and on the upwind side in windy locations. Wrap canes loosely (one to two wraps) around the wire and secure ends with flexible tie-tape.

Shoots from buds on these one-year-old canes produce fruit. Shoot thin to one shoot per node once shoots reach approximately 6 inches to prevent overcrowding. If vines set more than one cluster per shoot on average, thin to one cluster per shoot in this establishment year. Begin full shoot positioning practices—training upper tier shoots upward between catch wires and lower tier shoots downward using the moveable foliage wire.

Year three dormant pruning establishes the annual maintenance cycle. Select new fruiting canes close to the trunk to prevent "arms" from extending too far along the trellis over time. For cane-pruned systems (the traditional Scott-Henry approach), cut each of four canes to approximately 15 buds, providing 60 buds per vine on mature, vigorous plants. Leave 1-2 bud renewal spurs near the head to provide next year's cane selection options.

**Full production** develops progressively: light crop in year three, increasing production in year four, and full capacity typically reached by years five or six.

## Cane-pruned versus spur-pruned variations

Traditional Scott-Henry uses cane pruning, retaining four one-year-old canes annually (two per tier) selected fresh each dormant season. This approach dominates in cold-climate regions where winter injury makes permanent cordon structures risky, and it works particularly well with varieties that have unfruitful basal buds—common among American cultivars and many hybrids.

The **spur-pruned variation** (sometimes called Smart-Dyson after Dr. Richard Smart and his colleague John Dyson who formalized it) uses permanent cordons on both tiers with spurs positioned along their length. Spurs on the upper cordon point upward, while spurs on the lower cordon point downward, predetermining shoot direction and simplifying growing-season management. This approach suits mild climates with low winter injury risk and varieties with fruitful basal buds—common characteristics of many vinifera cultivars grown in California, Oregon's milder areas, Australia, and New Zealand.

Cane pruning provides flexibility after winter injury (damaged wood can simply be removed and replaced with healthy canes) and creates natural separation between tiers since upper and lower shoots emerge from physically distinct canes. Spur pruning reduces dormant pruning time on established vines but requires more careful shoot positioning during the growing season since shoots from adjacent spurs may intermingle.

For small-scale growers in cold-climate regions (USDA zones 5-6 and colder), cane pruning offers the practical advantage of adaptability—if winter kills portions of the vine, healthy canes can be selected from whatever survived.

## Annual dormant pruning protocols

Dormant pruning should occur in **late winter (February-March)** rather than fall, as fall pruning increases cold injury risk. In mild-winter regions, pruning can begin in December if labor constraints require an extended window.

Begin each vine by removing suckers at the base and canes arising from the trunk below trellis wires. Then assess remaining one-year-old wood to select four new fruiting canes (two for each tier). Prioritize canes that were exposed to sunlight the previous season, show at least pencil-width diameter (approximately 3/8 inch), display average internode length (5-8 inches for Concord types; 3-5 inches for hybrids and vinifera), appear healthy and disease-free, and originate close to the trunk.

**Bud count recommendations** vary with vine vigor:

For vigorous vines producing heavy pruning weights, retain 4 canes at 10-15 buds each, totaling **40-60 buds per vine**. For moderate-vigor vines, reduce to 4 canes at 8-10 buds each, totaling **32-40 buds per vine**. The balanced pruning guideline of approximately 14 buds per pound of pruning weight provides useful calibration.

Position selected canes on opposite sides of each post and on the upwind side in windy locations. Wrap canes loosely around the fruiting wire (one to two wraps—not tight) and secure ends with flexible tie-tape. Tight wrapping restricts vascular flow and should be avoided.

Leave 1-2 bud renewal spurs near the head of the vine at each tier level. These spurs produce vigorous shoots that become next year's cane selection options, maintaining fruiting wood close to the trunk rather than allowing it to extend progressively outward.

## Growing season shoot management

The growing season management calendar for Scott-Henry follows a predictable sequence with one critically time-sensitive operation: the downward positioning of lower-tier shoots.

**Shoot thinning** begins when shoots reach approximately 6 inches in length, typically several weeks after bud break. Thin to one shoot per node, removing secondary and tertiary shoots that compete for resources. Earlier thinning reduces accidental removal of primary shoots; later thinning wastes vine energy on shoots that will be removed. Target density remains approximately 5 shoots per linear foot of canopy for each tier.

**Upper tier management** mirrors standard VSP technique. As shoots grow, tuck them upward between paired catch wires to form a vertical foliage curtain. This typically requires 2-3 positioning passes between the 5-7 inch shoot stage and pea-sized berry development.

**Lower tier management** represents Scott-Henry's distinctive operation. The critical timing window opens at **beginning of flowering, before tendrils attach**—typically 2-3 weeks after bud break depending on climate and variety. Slide your arm into the canopy to physically separate shoots originating from the lower canes versus those from upper canes. Place the moveable foliage wire on top of the lower-cane shoots, holding them horizontally. The shoots will begin leaning outward into the row, assisted by wind.

At **early fruit set** (about 2 weeks after flowering), move the foliage wire downward and attach it to posts approximately 30 inches below the fruiting zone. This positions the lower-tier shoots definitively downward, where they continue growing geotropically for the remainder of the season.

The timing precision for this operation cannot be overstated. If done too early, shoots haven't grown enough to clearly identify their origin cane and may be damaged by handling. If done too late, tendrils have attached to catch wires or adjacent shoots, and separating them requires laborious individual detachment. The window typically spans only **3-5 days** during flowering, making this operation the primary management difference between Scott-Henry and simpler training systems.

**Leaf removal** in the fruit zone benefits both tiers but requires different approaches. The upper tier receives standard VSP-style leaf removal targeting 1-2 leaf layers remaining and 40-60% cluster exposure, preferentially on the morning-sun side. Timing at pea-sized berry stage (approximately 2 weeks after fruit set) allows fruit to acclimate to increased exposure.

The lower tier often requires more attention to leaf removal because downward-hanging foliage naturally covers fruit clusters. However, the naturally open canopy structure of properly managed Scott-Henry often reduces the intensity of leaf removal needed compared to dense VSP canopies. The key is maintaining the open "window" between tiers where air circulates freely.

**Hedging** requirements decrease substantially on Scott-Henry compared to high-vigor VSP installations. Research from Wisconsin found "no to minimal hedging" needed for vigorous cultivars that would require multiple passes on VSP. When hedging is needed, top the upper tier approximately 12 inches above the top catch wire. Avoid hedging before fruit set, which promotes unwanted lateral growth. Remove no more than 10-20% of canopy in any hedging pass and maintain at least 15 leaves per shoot for adequate photosynthesis.

## Balancing vigor between tiers

A well-managed Scott-Henry canopy shows relatively balanced vigor between upper and lower tiers, but natural plant physiology—particularly apical dominance—tends to favor upward growth. Upper tier shoots generally grow more vigorously than lower tier shoots on the same vine, and upper tier fruit typically ripens **7-10 days before lower tier fruit** due to better light exposure and different microclimate conditions.

Several management approaches address tier imbalance. The **alternating plant method** places fruiting canes of one plant on the lower wire and fruiting canes of the adjacent plant on the upper wire, preventing direct within-plant competition between tiers. This requires planning during establishment but simplifies ongoing balance management.

**Differential crop thinning** applies aggressive cluster thinning to the upper tier while leaving the lower tier relatively un-thinned. This redirects resources toward the naturally disadvantaged lower tier. Oregon consultant Evan Bellinger recommends: "Thin upper canopy aggressively, but thin lower canopy lightly."

**Timely downward positioning** itself devigorates shoots by disrupting hormonal signaling associated with upward growth. Getting shoots positioned downward early in their development—at the critical flowering window—reduces vigor disparity more effectively than late positioning.

## Troubleshooting common problems

**Upper tier dominating lower tier** represents the most common vigor-balance issue. Beyond the management techniques described above, ensure lower tier canes weren't wrapped too tightly during training (which restricts vascular flow), verify adequate water and nutrition reach the vine to support both canopy levels, and consider whether the variety simply lacks sufficient vigor for divided canopy management.

**Shoots going the wrong direction** typically results from incorrect timing during the critical positioning window. Shoots separated too early haven't developed enough to identify their origin; shoots separated too late have tendrils already attached. Train workers to clearly identify which cane each shoot originates from and accept that multiple positioning passes may be necessary in challenging years.

**Fruit quality differences between tiers** are inherent to the system rather than correctable problems. Upper tier fruit ripens earlier with slightly lower acidity, while lower tier fruit matures later with higher acidity and sometimes delayed sugar accumulation. Many growers harvest tiers separately: upper tier first for still wine production, lower tier about 10 days later—or earlier if targeting sparkling wine, rosé, or lower-alcohol styles where higher acidity and lower sugar concentrations prove desirable.

**Inadequate spray coverage** before shoots are positioned downward creates disease vulnerability during the critical flowering period. Time fungicide applications before the shoot-positioning window when the canopy architecture is "sticking out and crazy," as one New Zealand grower described it.

**When to convert back to VSP** becomes appropriate if site vigor proves insufficient to support two canopy tiers. Signs include weak shoot growth, small leaves, early shoot cessation, fruit failing to ripen adequately, and pruning weights below the 0.7 kg/m threshold. Low-vigor varieties like Merlot reportedly struggle on Scott-Henry in some locations due to insufficient vegetative vigor. The conversion back simply involves reverting to a single fruiting wire and training all shoots upward.

## Regional adaptations

**Cool-climate origins in Oregon** established Scott-Henry as a solution for high-vigor, disease-prone conditions. In the Umpqua Valley where Calvin Scott Henry developed the system, abundant rainfall and fertile soils created dense canopies that promoted rot before the divided canopy approach opened them up. Oregon's Willamette Valley has since adopted Scott-Henry extensively, particularly for Pinot Gris, Grüner Veltliner, and Chardonnay. Several Oregon growers report considering expanded Scott-Henry use as a climate-change adaptation strategy—the system's ability to slow ripening proves valuable as warming vintages push sugar accumulation faster than flavor development.

**Northeast and Midwest adoption** accelerated following Wisconsin's research demonstrating exceptional results with cold-climate hybrids. The Finger Lakes region of New York has embraced Scott-Henry at operations like Sheldrake Point Winery (43 of 57 acres) and Lakewood Vineyards, with growers reporting reduced disease pressure due to naturally thinner canopies. Cornell consultants suggest that "in the Northeast and in the Midwest, I think there really is no drawback to go to Scott Henry" for high-vigor situations.

**New Zealand and Australia** represent the largest global deployment of Scott-Henry, led by Delegat Wine Company's **5,240 acres** across Marlborough, Hawke's Bay, and the Barossa Valley. The vigorous growing conditions common to New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc production—where most vines prove unsuitable for VSP due to excessive growth—make Scott-Henry a natural fit. The open canopy's UV exposure inhibits fungal diseases while nearly doubling canopy surface area to ripen increased yields.

**Warm-climate applications** remain less extensively documented but UC Davis research confirms divided canopy efficiency across temperature regimes. The system may prove valuable in hot regions for moderating ripening speed—preventing excessive sugar accumulation before adequate flavor development—but requires attention to sun exposure to prevent fruit sunburn.

## Varietal selection for Scott-Henry

Varieties with **vigorous growth habits** succeed best on Scott-Henry. High-performing vinifera varieties include Grüner Veltliner ("so vigorous... Scott Henry helps absorb energy and vigor"), Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio/Pinot Blanc, and Sauvignon Blanc. Pinot Noir performs well for sparkling wine and rosé production though requires careful crop management for still wine to prevent overcropping.

Cold-climate hybrid varieties showing exceptional Scott-Henry performance in research trials include Frontenac, Marquette, La Crescent, and Brianna—all displaying the vigorous growth habits that benefit from divided canopy management. Brianna's naturally droopy growth habit actually suits the downward training requirement of the lower tier.

Varieties requiring caution include those with insufficient vigor to support two canopy levels. Merlot has been specifically noted as performing poorly on Scott-Henry due to low inherent vigor, with at least one grower converting Merlot back to VSP while maintaining Scott-Henry for more vigorous varieties on the same property.

## A practical starting point for backyard growers

For small-scale growers considering Scott-Henry, the Cornell-affiliated consultant Russell Moss recommends testing on a limited area first—approximately a 1-ton lot (roughly half an acre or 50-75 vines) provides sufficient experience before broader conversion. For backyard growers with 10-25 vines, converting even 5-10 plants to Scott-Henry while maintaining the remainder on VSP allows direct comparison under your specific site conditions.

The conversion itself requires minimal infrastructure investment: one additional fruiting wire positioned 6 inches below your existing wire, plus a moveable foliage wire attached to posts with clips that allow vertical repositioning. Total materials cost for a small test planting runs well under $100. The learning investment involves mastering the timing and technique of the shoot-positioning operation at flowering—a skill that, once developed, becomes routine.

If your vines consistently produce dense, vigorous canopies that require repeated hedging, develop disease pressure despite adequate spray programs, or produce fruit buried in leaf layers, Scott-Henry offers a proven pathway to better canopy management, improved fruit quality, and substantially increased yields without sacrificing the characteristics that attracted you to grape growing in the first place.
