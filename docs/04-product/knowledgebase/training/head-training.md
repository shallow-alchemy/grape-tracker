# Head Training Wine Grapes: A Complete Guide for Dry-Climate Growers

**Head training (goblet or gobelet) remains the optimal vine training system for small-scale, dry-farmed vineyards where water is scarce and premium wine quality is the goal.** This ancient technique—dating to Roman viticulture—creates free-standing, bush-like vines that develop extraordinarily deep root systems reaching **20 to 30 feet**, enabling survival on as little as **400mm (16 inches) of annual rainfall** without irrigation. The trade-off is lower yields and labor-intensive hand harvesting, but for growers prioritizing quality over quantity, the benefits are compelling: infrastructure savings of **$4,700–$7,500 per acre** versus trellised systems, vines that can remain productive for over a century, and concentrated fruit with exceptional flavor development.

## Why head training excels in water-limited environments

The fundamental advantage of goblet-trained vines lies in their hydraulic architecture. Without surface drip irrigation pulling roots upward, head-trained vines send roots deep into the soil profile, creating what viticulturists call "drought-adapted" physiology. Stan Grant of Progressive Viticulture explains that the twisted, gnarled permanent wood of mature goblet vines creates vascular resistance that moderates sap flow, enhancing tolerance for water stress compared to simpler bilateral cordon systems.

The three-dimensional goblet shape produces a smaller canopy that intercepts less light than vertically trained systems. This reduced leaf area means lower transpiration rates—the vine simply demands less water. Research published in the Journal of Experimental Botany confirms that Mediterranean viticultural traditions leveraging these principles (lower planting densities and smaller canopies) represent genuine adaptations to water scarcity, not merely historical accident.

**Fruit quality benefits emerge from this controlled stress.** Goblet vines achieve balanced fruit-to-shoot growth with minimal intervention, creating what viticulturists recognize as the three primary quality factors for premium wine grapes: balanced vegetative and reproductive growth, fruit exposure to dappled sunlight, and sustained moderate water stress through ripening. The uniform height of horizontally positioned spurs radiating from the head creates consistent ripening without the apical dominance problems that plague vertical cordon systems.

### Disease resistance through architecture

The open structure of properly maintained goblet vines promotes air circulation through the fruit zone, dramatically reducing fungal disease pressure. Grower Steven Rasmussen of Palisades Canyon in Napa reports that "with the openness of the canopy, we don't have the pressures of powdery mildew that you would have in trellised vineyards—we have to spray less often." This natural ventilation, combined with low humidity during Mediterranean growing seasons, allows goblet vineyards to operate with reduced spray programs.

Perhaps more significantly, head-trained vines demonstrate remarkable longevity. While trellised vineyards are typically replanted every **20 to 35 years** due to trunk diseases like Eutypa and Esca, single-stake goblet vines commonly remain productive for **50 to over 100 years**. Living examples include Barossa Valley vines planted in 1850, Henschke's Hill of Grace Shiraz from 1860, and Lodi's Bechthold Vineyard Cinsaut dating to 1886. This longevity stems partly from traditional pruning techniques that isolate pruning wounds on one side of the arm, minimizing sap flow disruption—the most effective prevention tool against grapevine trunk diseases.

## When to choose goblet training—and when to avoid it

### Climate and site requirements

Goblet training succeeds in hot, dry Mediterranean and Mediterranean-like climates with wet winters and dry summers. The system was traditionally widespread across Southern France (Languedoc, Rhône, Provence), Southern Italy (Sicily, Puglia, Sardinia), Spain (La Mancha, Rioja), and now thrives in similar California regions including Lodi, the Sierra Foothills, and dry coastal valleys. The key climate parameters include low summer humidity, sufficient winter rainfall to recharge deep soil moisture, and minimal disease pressure from fungal pathogens.

**Soil characteristics matter more than grape variety.** Ideal sites feature poor, low-fertility, deep, and frequently gravelly soils—the classic "poor dirt makes great wine" principle. Mediterranean winegrowers traditionally chose slopes with such soils because they absorbed winter rainfall but limited vigorous summer growth through low fertility. Sandy soils work if sufficiently deep, while heavy soils with high water-holding capacity may over-supply moisture, disrupting the delicate vine balance that makes goblet training effective.

Windy locations actually favor goblet vines. The low profile provides excellent protection against wind damage—on Sicily's Pantelleria island and the Azores, where Atlantic winds prohibit trellis systems entirely, bush vines trained in hollows are the only viable option. The system earned UNESCO World Heritage recognition through the alberello di Pantelleria tradition.

### Sites where head training fails

High-vigor locations undermine goblet training fundamentally. Where fertile soils, permanent water sources, or strong nitrogen availability push vines to excessive growth, the close arrangement of goblet spurs becomes congested, creating high humidity and elevated disease risk. Shoots exceeding four feet create imbalance, and the canopy becomes impassable at standard spacing. Such sites require divided canopy systems (Scott Henry, Geneva Double Curtain) that handle vigor through vertical or horizontal canopy splitting.

**Humid climates present insurmountable disease challenges.** Powdery mildew, downy mildew, and Botrytis thrive in humid conditions, and the dense head arrangement of goblet vines increases bunch-zone humidity while reducing spray penetration. Growers in such regions find that VSP (vertical shoot positioning) systems offer far better disease management through improved air circulation and spray coverage.

Finally, any operation requiring mechanical harvesting cannot use goblet training. The system was "widely used in Languedoc until the 1970s, then gradually abandoned" specifically because it proved "not compatible with mechanization." This economic reality limits head training to premium wine production where bottle prices justify hand labor.

## Training vines year by year: establishing the goblet form

### Year one: building the foundation

Begin with a decision about training timing. If planting material is high quality and soil is deep with moderate fertility, training can commence during the first year. On sites with average material or moderate growth potential, allow vines to "bush"—grow freely—the first season to maximize leaf area for root development.

**Install 5-foot stakes with approximately 2 feet buried**, leaving 3 to 4 feet above ground. Traditional split redwood stakes work well; treated wood or metal stakes are modern alternatives. Each vine requires one stake, which remains necessary until trunk diameter reaches 4 to 5 inches—a process taking many years on dry-farmed sites.

After planting, cut the vine back to one or two buds near the graft union (grafted vines) or crown (own-rooted vines). When growth commences, select two shoots and remove all others, training both up the stake with loose ties. Once secured and wind breakage risk has passed, remove the shorter shoot to concentrate resources. Remove all summer laterals (side shoots) to promote vertical trunk development. **The shoot must reach pencil diameter (3/8 inch or about 9mm) before proceeding to the next stage.** Remove all fruit clusters during year one—the vine needs all its energy for root and trunk development.

### Year two: establishing the head

The critical step of "topping" creates the permanent head position. If the shoot reaches **18 inches above the stake** early in the season (June–July), top it immediately. If growth reaches stake height only in late summer, delay topping until winter dormant pruning.

Make the topping cut at the first bud just below the stake top, cutting on a diagonal through the node. This removes the bud while retaining the swelled portion of the cane at the node, allowing a very tight tie without girdling. If trunk diameter has not reached pencil thickness at stake height, prune back to where diameter is adequate—never top a weak vine, as this creates a fragile head prone to breakage.

**Head height has no universal standard and ranges from 6 inches to over 30 inches.** Taller training (24–30 inches) reduces frost damage risk, allows greater shoot draping before ground contact, improves fruit-zone aeration, and reduces stooping during harvest. Shorter training provides better drought adaptation and takes advantage of soil warmth for ripening. Whatever height you choose, maintain consistency throughout the vineyard for uniform management.

### Years three through five: developing the goblet shape

Following the topping cut, lateral shoots near the trunk top will grow—these become the arms of the goblet. During the spring after topping, retain the top 5 to 6 shoots (or up to 8 on vigorous vines) and remove all lower growth. Select shoots that radiate outward as evenly as possible around the trunk "like spokes of a wheel."

These retained shoots form initial spur positions. Retain them as "long spurs" of 3 to 4 nodes, radiating outward from the head. Starting with 3 spurs the first year is common. The following winter, prune these initial spurs back to 2 buds. Over subsequent years, arms are divided and extended into branching arms, always maintaining even spacing. Direct arms both upward and outward, transitioning gradually from vertical to horizontal spur arrangement over several years.

**A fully developed goblet takes 4 to 5 years of conscientious training** and features a diameter of **24 to 30 inches** with **7 to 9 evenly spaced spur positions** at approximately the same height near the stake top. From this point forward, the goal becomes maintenance rather than development.

### Maintaining mature goblet vines over decades

Annual winter pruning maintains the goblet form by cutting canes back to **1-node spurs**. The gnarly, twisted growth accumulating over years creates the vascular resistance that enhances drought tolerance—this is a feature, not a problem.

To prevent heads from growing progressively taller, periodically retain a spur arising from old wood on the arm below the current spur position, then remove the portion of the arm beyond that renewal spur. This "resets" arm length and maintains the goblet within its 24- to 30-inch diameter. Mature vines eventually become self-supporting, though stakes may remain useful for decades in low-vigor conditions.

## Pruning techniques for head-trained vines

### Winter pruning fundamentals

Time dormant pruning for late winter to early spring, after the coldest temperatures have passed but before budbreak. In California, this typically means January through March; in colder climates, delay until late February or March to reduce freeze injury risk. The traditional saying captures this: "Prune early, prune late, but nothing beats pruning in March."

Approach each vine systematically. Stand back first to assess the overall goblet form, then begin at one spur position and work consistently around the head like a clock face. First remove obviously dead, diseased, or damaged wood. Then at each spur position, identify two key canes: the one closest to the head (retain as the new fruiting spur) and the one furthest from the head (remove completely). **Prune the retained cane to 1 to 2 buds** and cut the outer cane completely, removing about 5mm into old wood.

Making proper cuts requires attention to placement. Leave a stub of approximately **2 centimeters (¾ to 1 inch) above the last retained bud**, cutting at a slight angle slanting away from the bud to direct water runoff. When cutting into old wood, leave a stub twice the diameter of the cut to allow natural desiccation without damaging remaining tissue. **Expect to remove 80 to 90 percent of the previous year's growth.**

### Spur selection and renewal

Select canes of pencil diameter (3/8 inch) with good internode spacing of 3 to 4 inches between buds. Look for brown or cinnamon coloration indicating sun exposure—avoid shaded greenish canes. Reject "bull canes" (overly vigorous shoots exceeding half-inch diameter with long internodes and poor fruitfulness) and "straw canes" (thin, dried, or hollow wood).

When two shoots grow from one spur, keep the lower or inner shoot closest to the arm and remove the outer shoot completely. This maintains compact spur positions close to the permanent structure.

**Spur renewal from old wood is essential for long-term goblet maintenance.** When spur positions have "crept" too far from the arm or developed elongated "horns," look for latent buds on old wood below the current spur position. Retain a water sprout from this position during summer shoot thinning, then cut away the old extended spur during the following winter pruning. This resets arm length and maintains vine form. The notching technique—making a small cut above a latent bud on old wood to interrupt auxin flow—can stimulate shoots from specific positions where renewal is needed.

### Growing season shoot management

Thin shoots when they reach **5 to 12 inches in length**, after visible inflorescences help identify fruitful shoots but before bases become lignified and difficult to remove. Remove all shoots from the trunk below the head (suckers), shoots from old wood unless needed for renewal (water sprouts), multiple shoots from the same node (keeping the strongest), sterile shoots without clusters, and the weaker shoots at each spur position.

Retain 1 to 2 shoots per spur position for a total of 5 to 8 shoots per vine, depending on vigor. This early thinning is critical for maintaining the open goblet structure that promotes air circulation and disease resistance.

### Tools and maintenance

Quality bypass pruners (scissor-action for cleaner cuts on live wood) with cutting capacity of 1 to 1.5 inches handle most goblet pruning. FELCO, ARS, and Bahco represent industry standards. Battery-powered pruners like the Infaco F3020 increase productivity by approximately 30 percent for larger operations. Keep loppers available for older wood (1.5 to 2 inches) and folding hand saws for arm removal and severe renewal cuts.

**Sanitize tools between vines, especially when trunk diseases are present.** Seventy percent isopropyl alcohol is most practical—dip or spray blades between vines or at minimum between rows. Wipe blades clean after use, apply light oil, and sharpen regularly with a diamond or ceramic stone.

## Practical considerations for small operations

### Labor realities

Goblet pruning requires approximately **one-third more time than trellised systems**—expect 40 to 60 hours per acre compared to 15 to 30 hours for spur-pruned cordons. The skill level required is high; goblet pruning is described as "an art not unlike sculpting" where each vine requires individual assessment and visualization of future development. Training new workers takes 2 to 3 seasons to develop competence, unlike cordon pruning which can be taught quickly.

For small operations under 1 to 2 acres, one person can manage the work. The advantage lies in reduced summer canopy work compared to VSP systems—no shoot positioning is required, and hedging is minimal. However, pruning concentrates heavily in winter months, requiring sustained effort of 1 to 2 hours daily for several weeks.

### Infrastructure savings

**Trellis systems cost $6,000 to $10,000 per acre installed**, including 196+ line posts, 35 end posts with anchors, 6 wires per acre, and all hardware, tensioners, and clips. Head-trained vineyards require only stakes—approximately $800 to $1,500 per acre depending on materials and vine density. This translates to **savings of $4,700 to $7,500 per acre in establishment costs**.

Long-term maintenance differences compound these savings. Trellised vineyards require annual wire tensioning, replacement of 5 to 7 percent of posts annually, and complete wire replacement every 10 to 15 years. Head-trained vineyards need only occasional stake replacement until vines become self-supporting.

However, the slow return on investment is the major economic disadvantage. Goblet vines take 4 to 5 years to develop proper structure versus 2 to 3 years for cordon establishment, and yields remain lower (4 to 5 tons per acre versus 8 to 10 tons for vertical cordons). The economics only work when grape prices are sufficiently high—typically $2,000 or more per ton—to offset reduced production.

### Harvest challenges

**Hand harvesting is mandatory and significantly slower than trellised picking**—approximately three times slower. With fruit positioned low (6 to 30 inches from ground) and clusters often hidden under sprawling canopy, pickers must stoop or kneel while carefully lifting and parting foliage. Use small 5- to 10-gallon buckets with straps for hands-free movement, shallow lug boxes to prevent crushing, and sharp curved grape knives for clean cuts.

Training vines with higher head heights (24 to 30 inches) reduces back strain. Maintaining open goblet structure through proper pruning and early shoot thinning improves fruit visibility and picking efficiency. The quality benefit of hand harvest is cluster-by-cluster sorting—impossible with mechanical harvesters.

### Spacing recommendations

Traditional Mediterranean goblet spacing of 1.5 × 1.5 meters (approximately 5 × 5 feet) allowed cross-cultivation in both directions for weed control. Modern head-trained vineyards typically use 8 × 8 feet or wider spacing to accommodate tractor access. Row spacing should not be closer than vine height to minimize shading between rows.

Vine spacing within rows depends on vigor expectations: 5 to 6 feet for low-vigor dry-farmed sites, 8 to 10 feet for higher vigor or irrigated conditions. Wider spacing reduces water competition on dry-farmed sites and gives each vine greater soil volume for root exploration.

## Troubleshooting common problems

**Sunburn on exposed fruit** can damage 40 percent or more of the crop when canopy density is insufficient. Maintain adequate shoot numbers through proper spur counts—don't over-prune. Avoid late-season leaf removal on sun-exposed sides, and consider kaolin clay sprays (particle films) before heat waves.

**Uneven ripening** results from variable light exposure and cluster positioning. Proper goblet training with evenly spaced spurs promotes uniformity, as does spring shoot thinning to standardize shoot numbers. Multiple harvest passes—picking ripe fruit first and returning for later-maturing clusters—addresses any remaining variation.

**Soil contact and rot** affect low-positioned clusters touching the ground. Train vines with higher head heights (24 to 30 inches), remove lowest clusters during thinning, and maintain clean soil surface under vines. Raising the fruit zone by retaining only upper spurs provides permanent solution.

**Excessive vigor despite no irrigation** indicates deep fertile soils or high water table. Plant competitive cover crops (cereals, grasses) in row middles, avoid nitrogen fertilizers, and allow greater crop load to channel energy into fruit rather than vegetation. Traditional cross-cultivation severed surface roots and reduced vigor—an option with square-planted goblet vineyards.

### Converting existing vines

**Generally, conversion from trellised to head-trained systems is not practical.** Established vines have developed root and shoot architecture optimized for their current training, and severe cutting back stresses mature vines while risking trunk disease entry through large wounds. Conversion takes 3 to 5 years—the same time required for new planting—with lost production throughout.

Conversion from cane-pruned systems is somewhat more feasible since a head already exists, but the risks typically outweigh benefits. Replanting is recommended when vines are on cordon training, show trunk disease symptoms, are over 15 to 20 years old, or when different varieties are desired. Consider conversion only for young vines (under 5 years) that are already stake-trained but not yet goblet-formed, with no obvious disease issues and ability to accept reduced yields during the transition.

## Conclusion

Head training represents an elegant solution for small-scale growers in dry climates seeking premium wine grape production without major infrastructure investment. The system's deep-rooted vines survive and thrive on rainfall alone, producing concentrated fruit of exceptional quality while requiring no trellis installation or irrigation infrastructure. These advantages come with clear trade-offs: lower yields, mandatory hand harvesting, higher pruning skill requirements, and slower return on investment.

The decision to head-train ultimately depends on matching vineyard circumstances to system requirements. Where sites feature low to moderate vigor, poor soils, limited water, and a commitment to quality over quantity, goblet training remains—after millennia of refinement—the most appropriate approach. The practical path forward involves patient multi-year vine development, mastery of spur pruning and renewal techniques, and acceptance of the labor-intensive harvest that premium pricing must justify. For growers willing to invest this effort, head-trained vines offer not just wine, but a connection to viticultural traditions stretching back to antiquity.
