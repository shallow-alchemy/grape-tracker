# Bilateral cordon training: the practical guide for small-scale grape growers

The bilateral cordon system—featuring permanent horizontal arms extending from a central trunk—has become the global standard for wine grape production because it balances mechanization efficiency, predictable yields, and manageable labor demands. For backyard growers, this system offers a clean, organized structure that simplifies both pruning decisions and canopy management. The critical choice you'll face isn't whether to use cordons, but *how to prune them*: spur pruning (short 2-4 bud stubs) works beautifully for varieties with fruitful basal buds, while cane pruning (longer 10-15 bud canes) becomes necessary for varieties like Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay that set fruit further out on the cane. This guide provides the specific measurements, timing windows, and decision frameworks you need to establish and manage bilateral cordons successfully.

## Understanding the cordon architecture and why it dominates commercial viticulture

A bilateral cordon system consists of a single trunk topped by two permanent horizontal arms—the "cordons"—trained in opposite directions along a support wire, forming a distinctive T-shape. Unlike cane-pruned systems where fruiting wood is replaced annually, these cordons become permanent structures that can persist for **7-15 years** before requiring renewal, eventually reaching diameters of several inches.

**The fundamental structure includes:**
- A vertical trunk trained to the cordon wire height (30-42 inches for VSP systems, 60-65 inches for high-wire systems)
- Two horizontal cordons, each typically **3-4 feet long** (matching half the vine spacing)
- Spur positions spaced every **4-6 inches** along each cordon, or designated positions for annual cane selection

The commercial adoption of bilateral cordons accelerated dramatically with mechanization. Today, over **80% of California wine grapes** are machine-harvested, and the uniform framework of cordon-trained vines enables mechanization of pruning, shoot thinning, leaf removal, hedging, and harvesting. UC Davis research demonstrated that mechanical pruning on cordon systems reduces labor costs by **90%** compared to hand pruning. For small-scale growers, the benefit translates to simplified decisions—unskilled pruners can systematically prune all spurs to a uniform length without the judgment calls required for cane selection.

### The spur versus cane pruning decision hinges on basal bud fruitfulness

The single most important factor determining whether you should spur-prune or cane-prune your cordons is **basal bud fertility**—whether the buds closest to the cordon (positions 1-3) produce fruitful shoots.

**Varieties suited to spur pruning** (fruitful basal buds):
Zinfandel, Syrah/Shiraz, Merlot, Muscat varieties, Cabernet Franc, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Tempranillo

**Varieties requiring cane pruning** (low basal bud fertility):
Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Nebbiolo, Thompson Seedless, Concord (longer spurs)

**Varieties where either method works:**
Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon (regional variation), Flame Seedless, Lakemont

Research on French cultivars found that bud fertility was significantly greater from positions 4-10 compared to positions 1-3 in Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc, and even Merlot. If you're uncertain about your variety, cane pruning provides insurance—you'll capture fruitful buds regardless of their position.

## Trellis infrastructure for the bilateral cordon system

The bilateral cordon trellis can range from a simple single-wire high cordon to a full nine-wire VSP (Vertical Shoot Positioning) system. Your choice depends on variety vigor, climate, and how much canopy management labor you're willing to invest.

### Wire heights and configuration

**For VSP (low cordon, shoots trained upward):**
| Wire | Height from ground | Function |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Fruiting/cordon wire | **30-36 inches** | Supports permanent cordons |
| First catch wire pair | 42-48 inches | Captures growing shoots |
| Second catch wire pair | 54-60 inches | Continues vertical positioning |
| Third catch wire pair | 66-72 inches | Final shoot positioning |

**For high-wire cordon (shoots hang down):**
| Wire | Height from ground | Function |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Single cordon wire | **60-65 inches** | Supports cordons; shoots drape naturally |
| Optional catch wire | 30-36 inches | Prevents shoot drag on ground |

The **30-36 inch cordon height** for VSP places the fruit zone at waist-to-chest height—ergonomically ideal for hand harvesting, leaf removal, and cluster inspection. The **60-65 inch high wire** suits trailing varieties and minimizes summer labor, but requires reaching overhead for hand harvest.

### Post specifications and spacing

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| End posts | 5-6 inch diameter × 8-10 feet long, set 2-3 feet deep |
| Line posts | 3-4 inch diameter × 8 feet long, set 2 feet deep |
| Post spacing | **20-24 feet** (never exceed 24 feet to prevent wire sag) |
| Training stakes | 4-foot bamboo or metal at each vine |

**End post anchoring** is critical—a trellis under tension can pull inadequately anchored posts out of the ground. Use either an **earth anchor** (helix-type screw anchor at 45° angle, connected by guy wire) for rows under 600 feet, or an **H-brace assembly** (two vertical posts with horizontal crosspiece and diagonal wire) for longer rows or limited headland space. Target wire tension of approximately **250 pounds**.

### Materials and costs for small-scale implementation

**Per 100 linear feet of row (approximately 12-17 vines at 6-8 foot spacing):**
- End posts: 2 at $15-25 each
- Line posts: 4-5 at $8-15 each  
- Training stakes: 12-17 at $1-3 each
- High-tensile wire: 700 feet for 6-wire VSP at $0.05-0.10/foot
- Hardware (clips, anchors, fasteners): $30-50

**Total materials: $150-300 per 100 feet** for a basic VSP system.

**Per acre estimates:**
- VSP trellis materials: **$4,800-6,000**
- Installation labor (contracted): $2,000-3,000
- DIY installation time: 100-150 hours

## Establishing bilateral cordons from planting through production (Years 1-4)

### Year 1: Building the trunk foundation

The first year focuses entirely on developing a strong root system and a straight trunk to wire height. **Remove all fruit clusters immediately**—young vines cannot support crop production while establishing.

**Immediately after planting:** Cut the vine back to just 2 buds. This seems drastic but concentrates energy into root development.

**At 6-8 weeks:** Select 2-3 of the strongest upward-growing shoots as potential trunks. Keep "insurance" shoots in case of damage. Remove weaker competing shoots while still succulent, but retain leaves on the main trunk (they feed root development).

**Trunk training decision:**
- If the strongest shoot reaches **18 inches above the wire** by mid-summer (June-July), top it at the node just above the wire height
- If growth reaches the wire late (August-September), wait until dormant pruning to make cuts
- **Critical positioning:** Make the topping cut so the upper node sits **3-4 inches below** the fruiting wire (nodes rise as wood matures)

Tie developing shoots loosely to the training stake at 6-8 inch intervals. Support stakes should be rolled steel or rebar—not bamboo, which bends and breaks.

### Year 2: Laying down the cordons

**Dormant pruning (late winter):** Select two lateral shoots that emerged just below your Year 1 topping cut. These become your bilateral cordons.

**The critical "strong wood only" principle:** Canes are thickest at their base and taper toward the tip. Thin, weak wood produces poor-quality buds. **Cut back to the point where the cane maintains pencil diameter** (approximately ⅜ inch)—typically 15-18 inches or 4-7 healthy buds per arm.

**Bending technique to prevent breakage:**
- Work during mild temperatures, before buds swell (late winter/early spring ideal)
- Never bend frozen canes—they snap
- Create gentle curves, not sharp angles
- Secure loosely with tape or twist ties, leaving room for growth

**Growing season:** Again, remove all flower clusters. Allow shoots to develop along the laid-down cordons—these will become your future spur positions. If one arm grows more vigorously than the other, remove all fruit from the weak side and allow it extra shoots to balance growth.

### Year 3: Establishing spur or cane positions

**For spur pruning systems:** Complete cordon length if needed (extend another 5-6 nodes/18 inches per arm), then begin establishing permanent spur positions.

- **Target spacing:** Every **4-6 inches** along the cordon (6 inches is standard)
- **Orientation:** Select shoots pointing upward or outward—remove any oriented downward or horizontally
- **Create spurs:** Cut selected one-year-old canes back to **2-4 buds** each

**For cane pruning systems:** Establish the "head region" **5-8 inches below the fruiting wire** where renewal canes will originate each year. Leave 2-bud renewal spurs near the base of fruiting canes.

**First crop consideration:** If the vine shows vigorous growth filling its trellis space, you may allow a partial crop—**one cluster maximum per shoot**, removing clusters from any shoots shorter than 8 inches.

### Year 4: Transition to full production

By Year 4, vines with complete cordon structures can support full crop loads. Use the **Ravaz Index** as a guide: balanced vines produce 5-10 pounds of fruit per pound of pruning weight. For mature vines, target **40-60 buds** depending on vigor.

**Signs of overcropping (reduce bud count next year):**
- Delayed ripening
- Reduced sugar accumulation
- Weak cane growth for following season
- Loss of spur positions the following year

## Annual pruning protocol for cordon-spur systems

### Timing your dormant pruning

Prune **late winter through early spring** (February-March in most regions)—after the coldest temperatures have passed but before bud swell. Late pruning offers two advantages: reduced freeze injury risk from exposed pruning wounds, and the ability to assess winter damage before finalizing bud counts.

**Cold injury assessment:** Before pruning, cut sample buds longitudinally. Healthy buds show uniform green tissue; injured buds display brown or black primary buds. If you find 10-20% bud mortality, increase retained buds proportionally.

### Spur selection and positioning

**Select canes meeting these criteria:**
- **Diameter:** Pencil-size (¼ to ⅜ inch)—not thin "straw canes" or oversized "bull canes"
- **Color:** Brown/cinnamon indicating good sun exposure
- **Position:** Originating from the top or sides of the cordon, pointing upward
- **Internode spacing:** Normal 3-4 inch spacing between buds

**The critical rule:** Always select the **lowest cane of acceptable diameter** arising from the previous year's spur. This prevents "spur creep"—the gradual outward extension of spurs that creates unwieldy "arms" reaching away from the cordon, shifting fruit out of the defined zone.

**Spur spacing:** Target **4-6 inches apart** along the cordon, or approximately 2-3 spurs per linear foot. For an 8-foot vine spacing with 4-foot cordons per side:
- 8 spur positions per arm × 2 arms = **16 spur positions total**
- At 2-3 buds per spur = **32-48 buds per vine**

### Renewal strategy for aging spurs

Each year, a 2-bud spur produces two shoots that grow into canes. At the next dormant pruning:
1. Select the cane **closest to the cordon** for retention
2. Cut it back to 2-4 buds (the new fruiting spur)
3. **Remove the outer cane completely**
4. Optionally retain a 1-bud renewal spur to ensure replacement options

When spur positions become complex (stacked with multiple years of wood) or extend too far from the cordon, use canes emerging directly from the cordon itself to re-establish positions closer to the permanent wood.

### Managing the "bull cane" problem

Bull canes are excessively vigorous shoots with long internodes (5-6+ inches versus normal 3-4 inches), large diameter (over ½ inch), and often flattened cross-sections. They're **poorly fruitful, less cold-hardy**, and accelerate spur creep due to their extended internode length.

**Causes:** Over-pruning (too few buds retained), excessive nitrogen, over-irrigation—common in backyard settings with lawn irrigation overlap.

**Solutions:**
- Retain more buds at pruning (use balanced pruning formulas)
- Never use bull canes for spurs or trunk replacement
- Reduce nitrogen applications
- Adjust irrigation to mild water stress during growing season

## Annual pruning protocol for cordon-cane systems

Cane pruning on a cordon structure is less common than head-trained cane pruning (Guyot), but becomes necessary for varieties with low basal bud fertility or when renovating declining vineyards.

### Cane selection criteria

**Ideal canes possess:**
- **Diameter:** Pencil-size to slightly larger (¼-⅜ inch)—"little finger" thickness, not "thumb"
- **Length:** 3-5 feet, from which 10-15 buds can be retained
- **Color:** Well-browned, reddish-bronze with smooth bark
- **Internode spacing:** Uniform 3-4 inches between buds
- **Origin:** From the head region, 5-8 inches below the fruiting wire

### Bud counts and cane configuration

**Standard configurations:**
| System | Canes | Buds per cane | Total buds |
|--------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Single Guyot | 1 | 8-12 | 8-12 |
| Double Guyot | 2 (one each direction) | 10-15 | 20-30 |
| 4-cane Guyot | 4 (two each direction) | 10 | 40 |

The "two 10-bud canes per arm = 40 buds" configuration referenced in some guides represents a 4-cane system on a bilateral structure—higher production than typical wine grape targets.

### Renewal spur placement

Position **1-2 bud renewal spurs** near the base of each fruiting cane. These produce the shoots that become next year's fruiting canes. The annual cycle:
1. Shoots from renewal spurs grow into canes during the season
2. At dormant pruning, select the best cane to lay down as new fruiting wood
3. Cut a new renewal spur from a cane near the head
4. Remove the previous season's fruiting cane (now two years old)

**Tying canes:** Bend carefully to avoid cracking, lay horizontally along the fruiting wire, and fasten at multiple points using cloth strips, twist ties, or stretch tape. Complete tying while canes are still flexible, soon after pruning.

## Growing season management for bilateral cordons

### Shoot positioning creates the "cascading" canopy

The shoot positioning system described in professional references—where "summer foliage from the spurs is tied to the top wire, where it cascades over to shade the grapes"—describes VSP management through its full cycle:

**First pass (shoots 12-18 inches, 1-2 weeks post-bloom):** Raise the first pair of catch wires alongside the growing shoots, capturing them in a vertical orientation. Work **before tendrils attach**—waiting too long causes breakage and dramatically increases labor time.

**Second pass (2-3 weeks later):** Raise the second set of catch wires as shoots continue extending.

**Third pass (if needed):** For vigorous varieties, a final wire positioning may be necessary.

Once shoots exceed the top wire (~6 feet), they naturally fall over, creating the "cascading" effect. This canopy architecture provides dappled shade on the fruit zone while maintaining good air circulation. Hedging trims the top, giving rows their characteristic hedge-like form.

### Cluster thinning to one cluster per shoot

**The 2-1-None rule provides clear guidance:**
- Shoots longer than 20 inches: retain 2 clusters
- Shoots 8-20 inches: retain **1 cluster**
- Shoots shorter than 8 inches: retain **no clusters**

**Optimal timing:** At fruit set to pea-sized berries (approximately 2 weeks post-fruit set). Early thinning results in looser clusters with reduced rot susceptibility. Thinning at veraison ("green drop") removes lagging clusters but provides less quality benefit.

For the 40-50 bud systems described, one cluster per shoot with normal cluster weights (0.3-0.4 lb) yields approximately 4-6 tons per acre—appropriate for quality wine production.

### Leaf removal in the fruit zone

**Timing:** At fruit set to pea-sized berries. Early removal allows berries to acclimate to sun exposure. **Avoid removing leaves during or after veraison**—late-exposed fruit risks sunburn.

**Extent:** Remove **6 basal leaves per shoot** on the shade side of the canopy (east side for north-south rows). Retain 1-2 leaf layers on the afternoon sun side for protection. The goal is a "narrow window" around clusters for light and air movement.

### Hedging, suckering, and disease management

**Hedging:** Trim approximately **10-20%** of canopy, cutting about 1 foot above the top wire and sides as needed. Optimal timing is fruit set to veraison. Hedging before bloom causes excessive lateral growth; hedging after veraison diverts energy from ripening fruit. If you need to hedge more than 2-3 times per season, your vines are overly vigorous.

**Sucker removal:** Remove suckers from the trunk and water sprouts from cordons in April-May when they're small and snap off easily. Cut below the sucker base to remove latent bud whorls. Exception: Retain strategic suckers if you're planning trunk or cordon renovation.

**Disease advantages:** The open, organized canopy of properly managed bilateral cordons improves air circulation, reduces drying time, and enables better spray penetration—substantially reducing incidence of powdery mildew, downy mildew, and botrytis.

## Troubleshooting common problems

### Trunk diseases threaten permanent cordons

Eutypa, Esca, and Botryosphaeria trunk diseases are the primary threats to long-term cordon health. These fungi infect through pruning wounds—**95% of infections trace to this entry point**.

**Prevention strategies:**
- **Delay pruning to late February** (most effective single practice)—later pruning reduces wound susceptibility and coincides with fewer airborne spores
- **Apply wound protectants** within 3 days of pruning (thiophanate-methyl, boric acid in acrylic paint, or Trichoderma biological products)
- **Prune during dry weather** when possible
- **Remove infected wood** to well beyond visible cankers during summer dry periods
- **Sanitize pruning tools** between vines showing symptoms

Infections are permanent and incurable. Prevention in young vineyards is far more effective than remediation later.

### Correcting uneven cordon development

**During establishment:** Light hedging when primary lateral shoots reach 8-12 inches removes only shoot tips, allowing distal portions to catch up and creating more uniform spur positions.

**On established vines with vigor imbalance between arms:**
- Leave more buds on the weaker arm
- Remove more clusters from the weak side
- Thin shoots more heavily on the vigorous side
- Address underlying causes (irrigation, root competition)

### Replacing dead cordon sections

When cordons develop gaps of 2+ feet lacking productive spurs ("blind wood"), replacement becomes necessary:
1. During the growing season, maintain a shoot at the vine head or along the trunk
2. Allow this replacement shoot to grow vigorously all season
3. During winter pruning, train it as the new cordon
4. Remove the old cordon **in summer** (dry conditions reduce infection risk compared to winter removal)

## VSP integration: understanding the relationship

**VSP (Vertical Shoot Positioning) is a canopy management system, not a training system.** The bilateral cordon is the *training* system; VSP describes *how shoots are managed* on that structure.

| Feature | Bilateral Cordon + VSP | Bilateral Cordon (High Wire) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Shoot direction | Trained upward through catch wires | Hang downward naturally |
| Cordon height | Low (30-36 inches) | High (60-65 inches) |
| Catch wires | Required (3-4 pairs) | None or minimal |
| Summer labor | High (3-4 positioning passes) | Low (shoots "combed" down) |
| Best varieties | Low-moderate vigor vinifera | Vigorous hybrids, trailing growth |

**For backyard growers:** Full 9-wire VSP offers the best fruit quality and disease management but demands the most labor. High-wire cordon with shoots hanging naturally requires minimal summer management and suits vigorous cold-climate hybrids. A **4-6 wire modified VSP** (2 catch wire pairs instead of 3) offers reasonable compromise—accept a slightly less tidy canopy in exchange for reduced labor.

---

## Practical considerations for small operations

### Labor and skill requirements by system

| System | Setup complexity | Season labor | Skill level |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| High wire cordon | Low | Low-moderate | Beginner |
| Bilateral cordon + simplified VSP | Moderate | Moderate | Intermediate |
| Full VSP (9 wire) | High | High | Intermediate |
| Cane-pruned (Guyot) | Moderate | Moderate-high | Advanced |

**Specific time estimates:**
- Shoot positioning (VSP): 12-16 hours/acre over 3-4 passes
- Shoot thinning: ~1.6 hours/acre
- Dormant spur pruning: Significantly faster than cane selection

### Spacing recommendations

**Row spacing should equal or exceed canopy height** to minimize row-to-row shading:
- VSP: 6-8 feet between rows
- High wire cordon: 8-10 feet between rows

**Vine spacing** depends on site vigor:
- Vigorous sites (deep, fertile soil): 8-10 feet between vines
- Low vigor sites (shallow, rocky soil): 6 feet between vines
- Target: 3-5 shoots per linear foot of canopy

### When bilateral cordons make sense versus simpler systems

**Choose bilateral cordon + VSP when:**
- Growing vinifera varieties for wine quality
- Disease pressure requires excellent canopy management
- You're willing to invest in trellis infrastructure
- You want mechanization options as you scale

**Choose high-wire bilateral cordon when:**
- Growing vigorous hybrid varieties (Chambourcin, Norton, Frontenac)
- Minimizing summer labor is a priority
- Cold climate requires easy trunk replacement

**Consider head training (bush vines) when:**
- Very low vigor sites with water limitations
- Traditional varieties suited to it (Zinfandel, Grenache in hot climates)
- Minimal trellis investment desired
- You accept higher disease management challenges

## Conclusion: making the system work for your vineyard

The bilateral cordon system succeeds because it imposes order on an inherently chaotic plant. Your permanent horizontal arms create predictable spur positions, uniform shoot distribution, and a defined fruit zone—all of which simplify every subsequent management decision.

The key choices are straightforward: **match pruning method to variety** (spur for basal-fruitful varieties, cane for mid-cane fruitful ones), **match vigor to trellis** (low-moderate vigor for VSP, vigorous varieties for high wire), and **invest in infrastructure** proportional to your quality and mechanization goals.

For most backyard growers starting with vinifera varieties, a bilateral cordon at 30-36 inches with 4-6 catch wires offers the best balance of fruit quality, disease management, and reasonable labor demands. The cascading canopy that results—shoots trained upward, then falling over to shade the fruit—represents thousands of years of viticulture refinement, made accessible through a logical, repeatable system that rewards attention to timing and technique.
