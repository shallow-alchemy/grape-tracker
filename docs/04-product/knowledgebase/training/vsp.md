Vertical Shoot Positioning creates the most recognizable vineyard aesthetic—uniform green hedgerows with fruit hanging in a tidy band below—while delivering superior wine quality for varieties suited to the system. For small-scale and backyard growers working with **low to moderate vigor vines** in cool to temperate climates, VSP offers excellent fruit exposure, accessible management, and efficient spray coverage. The system positions shoots upward through a series of catch wires, creating a narrow canopy plane approximately four feet tall above a fruiting wire set at 30-36 inches. This guide provides the specific measurements, timing windows, and decision criteria needed to establish and manage VSP successfully on plantings of 10-100 vines.

## Overview and when VSP makes sense

VSP differs fundamentally from other training systems in its **upward shoot orientation**. While high-wire cordon systems let shoots hang downward and divided canopy systems like Geneva Double Curtain split growth into two curtains, VSP channels all shoot growth vertically into a single narrow plane. This maintains strong apical dominance—the vine's natural tendency to push growth toward the highest point—which intensifies vigor toward the top of the canopy and forces fruit clusters to the outside where they receive maximum sun exposure.

The system originated in the cool wine regions of Germany and France, where maximizing solar radiation on fruit is critical for ripening. It remains the dominant training system in Oregon's Willamette Valley (used on **78% of planted acres**), the Finger Lakes, and cool-climate regions worldwide. VSP works best with Vitis vinifera varieties that exhibit upright growth habits: Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Riesling, Cabernet Franc, and Gewürztraminer are ideal candidates. French-American hybrids with upright tendencies, such as Seyval Blanc and Vignoles, also perform well.

**Choose VSP when your site meets these criteria:**
- Low to moderate soil fertility producing **0.2-0.4 pounds of pruning weight per foot of cordon**
- Cool to moderate climate where sun exposure drives quality
- Vinifera or upright-growing hybrid varieties
- Wine quality priorities over maximum tonnage

**Avoid VSP when:**
- Soil organic matter exceeds 5% and deep fertile conditions drive excessive growth
- You're growing American-type grapes with procumbent (downward) growth habits
- Economic targets require yields exceeding 5 tons per acre
- Shoots consistently exceed six feet despite management interventions

For small-scale growers, VSP offers significant practical advantages. The hedge-like appearance requires no complex divided canopy infrastructure, the fruit zone sits at a comfortable working height for hand harvest, and spray coverage improves dramatically compared to sprawling canopies. The primary limitation is **labor intensity**—you'll make 2-3 shoot tucking passes during the growing season plus hedging, leaf removal, and dormant pruning. For 25-100 vines, this represents pleasant weekend work rather than burden.

## Infrastructure requirements for small plantings

Building a VSP trellis correctly from the start prevents years of frustration with sagging wires and leaning posts. The system requires substantial end post assemblies to handle wire tension, intermediate line posts for support, and **4-5 wires** positioned at specific heights.

### End post specifications

End posts bear the cumulative tension of all wires in the row and must be constructed to resist pulling forces. Use **4-6 inch diameter posts, 8-10 feet long**, with 2-3 feet buried at a **65-degree angle leaning away from the row**. Acceptable materials include pressure-treated pine (CCA or ACQ treated), black locust, or galvanized steel. For small plantings, the most practical anchoring method is a **screw anchor**: a 6-inch diameter plate installed 30 inches deep, positioned 4 feet from the base of the post, with heavy gauge wire connecting the anchor to the post top. This provides excellent holding power without consuming the space an H-brace requires.

### Line post specifications

Line posts support the wires between end assemblies. Space them **18-21 feet apart** (never exceeding 24 feet) using **3-4 inch diameter posts, 8 feet long** with 2 feet buried. This typically means one line post for every 3 vines at standard 6-foot vine spacing. Steel T-posts work acceptably for catch wires in small plantings, but wooden posts provide better durability and easier wire attachment at multiple heights. Total post height above ground should reach **6 feet** to accommodate the full wire configuration.

### Wire configuration and heights

Standard VSP uses five wires configured as follows:

| Wire | Height from ground | Purpose |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Fruiting wire | 30-36 inches | Permanent support for cordons or canes |
| First catch wire pair | 42-48 inches | Initial shoot capture |
| Second catch wire pair | 54-60 inches | Mid-canopy support |
| Top catch wire | 66-72 inches | Final shoot containment |

The fruiting wire bears the heaviest load and should be **11-12.5 gauge high-tensile galvanized steel**, tensioned to approximately 250 pounds. Catch wires can be lighter gauge (12.5-14 gauge) since they only guide shoot growth. Space catch wire levels **10-12 inches apart** vertically to create adequate room for shoot tucking.

### Moveable versus fixed catch wires

For plantings under 25 vines, fixed catch wires provide adequate simplicity—you'll tuck shoots by hand between the paired wires during 2-3 passes per season. For 50-100 vines, moveable catch wires significantly reduce labor: you lower the wire pairs to ground level in spring, then lift them progressively as shoots grow, "sweeping" the canopy upward. Moveable systems require chain or hooks at end posts to secure wires at different heights, plus wire clips at each vine (approximately $0.03-0.05 each) to keep paired wires together. The hardware investment pays back quickly in reduced tucking time.

### Cost estimates for small plantings

Material costs for VSP trellis run approximately **$10-25 per vine** depending on materials chosen. Budget estimates:

| Planting size | Approximate row length | Materials cost |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 10 vines | 65 feet | $150-300 |
| 25 vines | 165 feet | $350-600 |
| 50 vines | 330 feet | $600-1,100 |
| 100 vines | 660 feet | $1,200-2,000 |

These costs include posts, wire, anchors, and hardware but not labor or vines. VSP costs approximately 60% more than a simple single high-wire system but significantly less than divided canopy systems requiring cross-arms.

## Establishment procedures from planting through first crop

### Year one: building the foundation

Plant bare-root or container vines in early spring as soon as soil can be worked, at the same depth they grew in the nursery. Install a **training stake at each vine**—rolled steel or rebar reaching fruiting wire height works better than bamboo for durability. After planting, prune each vine to a single 2-bud spur, then allow two shoots to emerge initially for insurance against damage.

When shoots reach **6-12 inches**, select the single strongest shoot for trunk development and remove all others. Tie this shoot loosely to the training stake at 8-12 inch intervals using soft tape or string—never wire or twist-ties that can girdle expanding growth. Remove all lateral shoots (side growth from the main trunk shoot) throughout the season to concentrate vine energy into vertical growth, but retain the main leaves which produce carbohydrates for root development. Remove any flower clusters that appear; no fruit in year one.

**Growth benchmarks:** Expect 3-4 feet of shoot growth on good sites by season's end, with cane diameter approaching pencil thickness (3/8 inch) at the base. If the shoot reaches the fruiting wire, you're ahead of schedule. If growth is weak (under 18 inches), prune back to 2-4 buds at dormant pruning and restart trunk development the following year. Provide **0.5-1 inch of water weekly** during establishment and apply a light fertilizer application (approximately 0.5-1.0 ounce nitrogen per plant) at bud break.

### Year two: establishing permanent structure

Vines that reached the fruiting wire in year one can begin cordon or cane establishment. For vines still developing trunks, continue training the strongest shoot upward. The permanent structure you establish now—either bilateral cordons (for spur pruning) or fruiting cane positions (for cane pruning)—will produce fruit for decades.

**For spur-pruned VSP (bilateral cordons):** When the trunk reaches wire height, select two shoots near the wire and train them horizontally in opposite directions along the fruiting wire. Pinch the terminal ends when shoots reach the adjacent vine halfway point—approximately 3 feet per cordon at 6-foot vine spacing. This forces secondary shoots to develop along the cordon, which become next year's fruiting spurs.

**For cane-pruned VSP (Guyot system):** Retain two shoots growing 2-6 inches below the training wire and train them horizontally along the wire, one in each direction. Remove all other shoots while small. At dormant pruning, cut these canes to **8-12 buds each** to become the fruiting canes for year three.

Remove all fruit clusters in year two. This seemingly difficult sacrifice ensures the vine directs energy toward root development and permanent structure rather than exhausting itself on premature fruit.

### Year three: first meaningful harvest

With structure established, year three brings your first crop—though still at reduced levels to protect continuing vine development.

**For spur-pruned vines:** Fill any gaps in the cordon with retained shoots and establish spur positions **every 4-6 inches** along each arm. Spurs should originate from the top or sides of the cordon (remove downward-oriented spurs). Prune each spur to **2-3 buds**. Target a maximum of 30-40 buds total per vine.

**For cane-pruned vines:** Select two new one-year-old canes from the head region, each 3-5 feet long with pencil diameter and brown/cinnamon color indicating mature wood. Prune each cane to approximately 15 buds (30 total). Wrap canes loosely around the fruiting wire and secure with flexible tape. Critically, retain **1-2 renewal spurs** (2 buds each) near the trunk head to provide next year's cane options.

**Crop expectations:** Allow one cluster per shoot maximum in year three. Remove the second cluster from any shoot producing multiples, and remove all clusters from shoots shorter than 3 feet. Expect approximately 2 tons per acre equivalent yield. Watch for these signs indicating readiness for full production: cane diameter consistently at pencil thickness, adequate shoot growth (3-4+ feet), pruning weights of 0.2-0.4 pounds per linear foot of cordon, and no significant gaps in spur positions. Most vines reach full production by **year 4-5**.

## Annual management in the dormant season

### Pruning timing and technique

Prune after the coldest winter temperatures have passed but before bud swell. This timing varies significantly by region:

| Region | Optimal pruning window |
|--------|----------------------|
| California | January-February |
| Oregon | December-February |
| Washington | February-March |
| Finger Lakes/New York | March-April |
| Virginia/Pennsylvania | February-early March |

Delaying pruning can delay bud break by 5-7 days—a useful frost avoidance strategy in marginal climates. However, avoid pruning just before rain events, which increases trunk disease infection risk.

**Spur-pruned VSP:** Maintain spurs **4-6 inches apart** along the cordon, positioned on the top and sides only. Prune each spur to **2-3 buds** (counting above the basal non-count bud). Select spurs closest to the cordon with pencil-diameter canes showing brown/cinnamon exterior and green interior. Remove "bull canes" (over 1/2 inch diameter with long internodes) and thin, pale "straw canes."

**Cane-pruned VSP:** Select canes originating 5-8 inches below the fruiting wire with approximately 3/8 inch diameter, even internode spacing, and 3-5 feet of well-ripened wood. Prune to **10-15 buds per cane** depending on vine spacing and vigor. Wrap loosely around the fruiting wire, securing at 2-3 points with flexible tape. Always retain renewal spurs near the head for next year's cane options.

### Calculating proper bud counts

Target **4-5 shoots per linear foot of canopy** for VSP systems. For a vine with 6-foot total cordon length, this means 24-30 buds retained. Use balanced pruning formulas as guidelines: for vinifera, approximately **15 buds per pound of pruning weight**. Weigh your prunings from several representative vines annually to calibrate your bud retention decisions.

### Tie-down procedures

For cane-pruned systems, tie canes down **immediately after pruning** or within a few days—certainly before bud swell when emerging shoots become fragile. Use the highest trunk tie very tight to anchor the vine's position, with lower ties loose enough to accommodate trunk expansion. Check all ties annually and replace any that show signs of girdling. Use figure-8 or loose loop configurations when tying around trunks, never a complete wrap without crossing between trunk and support.

## Growing season management protocols

### Shoot positioning and tucking

Begin shoot positioning when growth reaches **12-18 inches**, before tendrils have firmly attached to wires or adjacent shoots. The goal is achieving a uniform vertical curtain with shoots evenly distributed—think of creating a comb-like arrangement where each shoot occupies its own space without overlapping neighbors.

Lift shoots from below and guide them upward between paired catch wires. For moveable wire systems, lower the wire pair, swing it out and under the shoots, then lift upward to capture the foliage and reattach to posts. Work during **early morning or late afternoon** when shoots are most flexible and workers avoid midday heat stress.

Plan for **2-3 positioning passes** through the season for most varieties, with vigorous cultivars requiring up to 4 passes. Combine wire raising with shoot positioning to maximize efficiency. Signs you've fallen behind: shoots growing horizontally along the cordon, tendrils firmly attached making positioning difficult, and entangled shoots that break when repositioned.

### Catch wire raising schedule

Raise moveable catch wires when **approximately 80% of shoots reach each wire level**. Position the first wire pair no more than 6 inches above the cordon initially for efficient shoot capture. A typical schedule moves the first wire pair 3-4 weeks after bud break when shoots reach 12-15 inches, the second pair 2-3 weeks later, and completes final positioning before shoots begin arching over. Set wires to their winter positions after harvest to prepare for the next season.

### Leaf removal in the fruit zone

Removing leaves around clusters improves spray penetration, reduces disease pressure, and enhances fruit quality—the timing and extent depend critically on your climate.

**Timing:** Remove leaves between **fruit set and bunch closure** (when berries reach peppercorn to pea size, approximately 2-3 weeks post-fruit set). Earlier removal at bloom can reduce cluster compactness in rot-susceptible varieties like Pinot Noir, but risks yield reduction. Never remove significant leaf area at or after veraison—berries lose heat tolerance and burn within minutes at high temperatures.

**Amount:** Remove **3-4 leaves per shoot** in the cluster zone for moderate removal. Target 1-2 leaf layers remaining in the fruit zone (measured by inserting a thin rod through the canopy and counting contacts) with **40-60% cluster exposure**. This is not complete stripping but selective opening.

**Which side matters tremendously:**

- **Cool climates (Oregon, Finger Lakes, Michigan):** Remove leaves on **both sides** of the cluster zone. Complete fruit zone exposure improves ripening without sunburn risk in moderate temperatures. Late-season removal as the sun angle lowers can extend exposure benefits.

- **Warm climates (California inland valleys, eastern Washington):** Remove leaves on the **morning sun side only** (east for north-south rows, north for east-west rows). Retain leaves on the afternoon sun side to prevent sunburn. Never remove west-side leaves until late summer when temperature extremes have passed.

### Hedging and topping

Hedge when shoots have emerged through upper catch wires and begun to arch over, typically 3-4 weeks after bloom at the earliest. Cut approximately **12 inches above the upper foliage wires**, leaving 15-20 nodes per shoot. Use long-handled hedge shears or gas-powered hedge trimmers for small-scale operations.

**Critical timing considerations:** Never hedge before, during, or immediately after bloom—this decreases fruit set and yield. Hedging while soil moisture remains abundant stimulates aggressive lateral regrowth, potentially creating a denser canopy than before. If you find yourself hedging more than twice per season, your vines have a vigor problem requiring systemic solutions rather than repeated cutting.

An alternative technique called **shoot tressage** (braiding) rolls shoots over the top wire instead of cutting them. This avoids stimulating lateral regrowth while controlling canopy height, though it requires more labor than mechanical hedging.

### Managing vigor for VSP success

VSP functions optimally within a narrow vigor band. Excessive vigor overwhelms the system with dense growth, poor fruit exposure, and disease pressure. Inadequate vigor leaves canopy gaps, reduces photosynthetic capacity, and compromises fruit development.

**Signs of excessive vigor:**
- Shoots continue active growth at or after veraison (they should stop before)
- Abundant lateral shoot development throughout canopy
- Long internodes (significantly greater than 3-5 inches)
- More than 6 shoots per foot of row
- Pruning weight exceeding 0.4 pounds per foot of cordon
- Dense canopy with more than 2-3 leaf layers in fruit zone

**Signs of inadequate vigor:**
- Shoots fail to fill trellis space
- Small leaves and short shoots with fewer than 10 nodes
- Shoots stop growing well before veraison
- Fewer than 4 shoots per foot of row
- Pruning weight below 0.2 pounds per foot of cordon

**Reducing excessive vigor:** Implement competitive cover crops (especially under-vine), restrict irrigation after fruit set through regulated deficit irrigation, reduce or eliminate nitrogen fertilization, and increase crop load slightly to redirect vine resources. Long-term solutions include selecting devigorating rootstocks for replanting or converting to a divided canopy system if vigor consistently overwhelms VSP management.

**Boosting inadequate vigor:** Increase irrigation particularly early season, apply nitrogen fertilizer between bloom and 6 weeks post-bloom, reduce crop load through early cluster thinning, eliminate cover crop competition temporarily, and check for virus infections or nematode damage that may be limiting vine performance.

## Troubleshooting common problems

### Overly vigorous growth overwhelming the canopy

When vines consistently produce dense, arching growth requiring repeated hedging, immediate management cannot substitute for addressing root causes. Short-term, thin shoots aggressively to 4-5 per foot, remove basal lateral shoots in the fruit zone rather than main leaves, and consider leaving a heavier crop to compete for vine resources. Long-term, install competitive cover crops, restrict water and nitrogen, and consider whether VSP remains appropriate for your site. Sites with soil organic matter exceeding 5% and deep fertile soils may simply be too vigorous for VSP—Geneva Double Curtain or Scott Henry divided canopy systems handle this vigor more effectively.

### Inadequate vigor leaving canopy gaps

Weak vines producing thin canes and sparse canopies need investigation. Check for virus infections (leafroll and red blotch cause progressive decline), nematode damage, or poor soil conditions. Provide supplemental water, reduce crop load dramatically, and consider applying fertilizer in measured amounts. If replanting becomes necessary, select rootstocks appropriate for your soil type rather than assuming the original choice was correct.

### Fruit zone shading despite management

Persistent shading indicates canopy density problems. Measure leaf layer number by inserting a thin metal rod randomly through the fruit zone 50-100 times and recording contacts—target 1-1.5 leaf layers with 20-40% gaps. Remove lateral shoots from the fruit zone rather than main leaves to open the canopy while retaining some sunburn protection. If shading persists, your shoot density likely exceeds VSP capacity and requires more aggressive thinning or system conversion.

### Wind damage prevention

VSP's catch wire system provides significant wind protection once shoots are properly positioned, but young growth remains vulnerable. Orient rows **parallel to prevailing winds** where possible. Ensure timely shoot tucking so shoots are secured between wires before major wind events. In extremely windy sites, reduce line post spacing to 15 feet and consider permanent or temporary windbreaks positioned far enough away to avoid shading or competition.

### Disease pressure in tight canopies

VSP concentrates growth into a narrow plane that can increase humidity and extend drying times if canopy density isn't managed. Shoot thin to 5-6 shoots per foot maximum, remove basal leaves at fruit set for improved air circulation, and orient rows in the direction of prevailing winds. For Botrytis-susceptible varieties like Pinot Noir and Riesling, early leaf removal at bloom reduces cluster compactness by limiting carbohydrate flow to developing clusters. Four critical fungicide spray timings—immediate pre-bloom, bloom, 1-2 weeks post-bloom, and pea size—address the most vulnerable infection periods.

## Regional considerations for VSP success

### Cool climates: maximizing sun exposure

In Oregon, the Finger Lakes, Michigan, and similar cool regions, VSP excels precisely because it positions clusters for maximum solar radiation. The low fruiting wire (30-36 inches) places fruit near radiant heat reflected from the vineyard floor. Aggressive leaf removal on both sides of the cluster zone improves ripening without sunburn risk. As harvest approaches and the sun angle lowers in October, complete fruit zone exposure captures the diminishing radiation needed to complete maturation.

Cool-climate growers should target **2.0 square meters of leaf area per kilogram of fruit** rather than the standard 0.8-1.2 square meters used in warmer regions—the additional photosynthetic capacity compensates for reduced solar intensity. Under-vine competition with cover crops effectively controls the excess vigor common in cool, moist climates while maintaining the vine balance VSP requires.

### Warm climates: preventing damage while maintaining quality

In California's Central Valley, eastern Washington's warm sites, and similar regions, VSP requires more nuanced management. Excessive vigor remains the primary challenge—abundant heat and irrigation capacity drive shoot growth beyond what the narrow VSP canopy can accommodate. Retain afternoon-side leaves to protect fruit from sunburn temperatures exceeding 40°C. Remove lateral shoots rather than main leaves when opening the fruit zone.

Consider adding **cross-arms to widen the canopy** and create dappled light penetration rather than the complete exposure appropriate for cool climates. The Smart-Ballerina modification—allowing shoots to drape outward and downward rather than cutting them—provides additional canopy capacity without major infrastructure changes. If vigor consistently overwhelms VSP, conversion to a divided canopy system may be the economically rational choice despite the infrastructure investment.

### Varietal-specific adjustments

**Pinot Noir** has become nearly synonymous with VSP, particularly in Oregon where more than 78% of vineyard acres use the system. Its generally moderate vigor makes it ideal for high-density planting with VSP training. However, Pinot's tight clusters and thin skins demand vigilant canopy management—early leaf removal is essential for cluster health, and many producers still thin 25-40% of crop despite careful shoot management.

**Chardonnay** responds well to VSP with cane pruning but requires attention to its early bud break timing and Botrytis susceptibility from tight clusters. White varieties are less tolerant of extreme exposure than reds; retain some protection in warm climates to prevent browning.

**Cabernet Sauvignon** suits VSP's upright training despite inherent vigor that may require intervention on fertile sites. Its later bud break allows you to prioritize early-breaking varieties during spring shoot thinning. Loose cluster architecture provides more disease tolerance than tight-clustered varieties.

**Riesling** performs well in VSP but shares Pinot's Botrytis susceptibility from tight clusters. Early leaf removal at bloom helps reduce cluster compactness. Research demonstrates that modified "wide VSP" configurations can increase yield without compromising Riesling quality.

**Hybrids** vary significantly in their suitability for VSP. Those with upright growth habits (Seyval Blanc, Vignoles) work well; those with procumbent tendencies fight the vertical training throughout the season. If forcing an unsuitable hybrid into VSP, expect significantly more labor maintaining vertical orientation.

## When VSP is working—and when to reconsider

A well-functioning VSP vineyard displays unmistakable characteristics: shoots stop growing before veraison, the canopy fills the trellis space completely without requiring excessive hedging, lateral development remains moderate, internodes measure 3-5 inches, and clusters are visible with good airflow. The pruning weight to crop weight ratio falls between **1:5 and 1:10**, indicating proper vine balance.

Consider converting to a different system if you consistently require more than two hedging passes annually, shoots regularly exceed six feet despite management, dense canopy persists despite intervention, or economic requirements demand yields above 5 tons per acre that VSP cannot efficiently produce. Geneva Double Curtain provides approximately 50% higher yield potential for high-vigor vines; Scott Henry offers vertical canopy division while retaining VSP-like structure; Lyre provides horizontal division with good disease defense.

For small-scale growers matching appropriate varieties to sites with moderate vigor, VSP delivers exceptional fruit quality with manageable labor investment. The system rewards attention to detail—timely shoot positioning, appropriate leaf removal, and responsive vigor management—with clean, well-exposed fruit that expresses both variety and site. The hedge-like appearance also provides aesthetic satisfaction throughout the growing season, transforming a backyard planting into a genuine vineyard.
