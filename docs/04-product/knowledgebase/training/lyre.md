The Lyre system doubles your effective canopy surface while keeping fruit protected beneath upward-growing shoots—a solution developed specifically for vigorous vines struggling with shade. Originally created in Bordeaux for disease-prone maritime climates, this horizontally divided trellis trains shoots outward into a distinctive U-shape, functioning essentially as two VSP systems angled apart on a single vine. For small-scale growers on high-vigor sites who can invest the labor, Lyre delivers **50% or greater yield increases** over single-canopy systems without sacrificing fruit quality.

The system requires careful consideration before installation. Cross-arms spanning 3.5 to 4 feet, multiple wire configurations, and labor-intensive shoot positioning make Lyre among the most expensive trellises to build and maintain. Standard mechanical harvesters cannot navigate its divided structure. Yet for backyard growers hand-harvesting upright-growing vinifera varieties like Cabernet Franc or Pinot Gris on fertile soil, Lyre offers unmatched canopy management and disease resistance that simpler systems cannot provide.

## Understanding how Lyre differs from other divided canopy systems

Dr. Alain Carbonneau developed the Lyre system at France's Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) in Bordeaux during the early 1980s. The name references the ancient Greek stringed instrument whose curved arms mirror the trellis's U-shaped profile when viewed end-on. Carbonneau designed the system specifically to combat mildew pressure in Bordeaux's humid climate while boosting photosynthetic capacity for varieties that naturally grow upward.

The critical distinction separating Lyre from Geneva Double Curtain—the other major horizontally divided system—lies in shoot orientation. **GDC trains shoots downward**, exploiting the natural trailing habit of American grape varieties like Concord. **Lyre trains shoots upward at 10-15 degrees from vertical**, accommodating the inherent growth pattern of Vitis vinifera and most European wine grapes. This upward positioning places fruit clusters beneath the canopy rather than on top, providing natural sun protection that GDC cannot offer.

Scott-Henry and Smart-Dyson systems divide canopies vertically rather than horizontally. These systems stack two fruit zones at different heights within a single vertical plane, with upper shoots trained upward and lower shoots trained downward. This configuration allows standard mechanical harvesters to navigate the vineyard—a decisive advantage that has made vertically divided systems increasingly popular as labor costs rise. Dr. Richard Smart, author of the influential "Sunlight into Wine" and originator of the Smart-Dyson system, now recommends vertically divided approaches for most commercial operations requiring mechanization.

Compared to standard VSP (Vertical Shoot Positioning), Lyre essentially creates two parallel VSP systems on a single vine. Where VSP manages all shoots within a single plane, Lyre separates them into two distinct curtains with open space between. This division proves essential on vigorous sites where VSP canopies become excessively dense, creating interior shade that reduces bud fruitfulness, delays ripening, and promotes disease.

### When Lyre becomes the right choice

The system excels under specific conditions that small-scale growers should evaluate honestly before committing to installation:

- **High-vigor sites**: Fertile soils with adequate water producing cane pruning weights exceeding 0.7 kg per meter of row benefit most from canopy division
- **Upright-growing varieties**: Cabernet Franc (ideal match), Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc, Merlot, and most vinifera with naturally erect shoot growth
- **Manual harvest operations**: Lyre cannot accommodate standard mechanical harvesters
- **Disease-prone climates**: The open canopy center dramatically improves air circulation and spray penetration in humid regions
- **White wine production**: Fruit positioned beneath the canopy receives protection from direct sun exposure, preserving delicate aromatics and preventing excessive phenolic development

Avoid Lyre on low-vigor sites where vines cannot fill the expanded trellis capacity. Cold climates with regular winter trunk injury present elevated risk given the system's extensive cordon development—four cordon sections total when both arms carry bilateral cordons. Operations dependent on mechanical harvest should consider Scott-Henry or Smart-Dyson alternatives.

### Yield and quality expectations

Research consistently demonstrates that properly managed Lyre systems increase yields **50% or more** over single-canopy configurations without reducing fruit quality. Carbonneau's original trials in Bordeaux documented simultaneous improvements in yield, fruit composition, and sensory scores. Dr. Smart's work with Cabernet Franc in New Zealand found that canopy division more than doubled production while actually improving wine quality—the shade eliminated by the divided structure was degrading fruit far more than the yield increase.

However, these results require adequate canopy management. Neglected Lyre systems with interior shading quickly lose their advantages over simpler configurations.

## Infrastructure requirements for small-scale installations

Building a Lyre trellis demands more substantial materials than VSP or single-wire systems. The cross-arms supporting divided cordons transfer significant load to posts, and multiple wire configurations require careful planning. Budget approximately **$7-12 per vine in materials** for a 100-vine planting, with per-vine costs rising to $15-25 for smaller 10-vine installations lacking economies of scale.

### Post specifications

**End posts** anchor the entire system and must resist considerable wire tension. Use pressure-treated wood (CCA-treated pine rated for 20-30 year ground contact) with minimum **5-6 inch diameter** and **8-10 foot length**. Set posts **3-4 feet deep**, leaving 5-6 feet above ground. Each row requires two end posts plus appropriate anchoring—either earth anchors (6-inch helix minimum) or deadman anchors for particularly heavy soil.

**Line posts** between end posts support the trellis at intervals. Standard specifications call for **3-4 inch diameter** posts **8 feet long**, set **2 feet minimum** into the ground. Pressure-treated wood performs well for small installations; steel stakes offer longevity but higher initial cost.

**Post spacing** ranges from 20-25 feet for most applications. Denser vine spacing (7-foot intervals) supports 21-foot post spacing; wider vine spacing (8-10 feet) allows 24-28 foot post intervals. Never exceed 30 feet between posts—wire sag under crop load becomes problematic.

### Cross-arm configuration

The defining structural element of Lyre systems, cross-arms must span **42-48 inches (3.5-4 feet)** to separate the two cordons adequately. This width provides sufficient interior space for light penetration and canopy management while keeping the structure within practical limits.

Materials options include galvanized steel T-bars (durable, standardized holes for wire attachment), pressure-treated 2×4 lumber (economical, easily customized), or fiberglass-reinforced plastic (lightweight, expensive). Cross-arms mount at or near the top of line posts, typically **5-6 feet above ground**.

The angle of shoot positioning matters: Lyre trains shoots **10-15 degrees from vertical**, angling outward rather than straight up. This creates the characteristic U-shape and ensures adequate separation between curtains.

### Wire configuration

Lyre requires more wire than GDC but comparable complexity to VSP, distributed across a divided structure:

| Wire Type | Position | Gauge | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| Trunk support | ~30-32 inches above ground | 10-11 | Supports trunk to division point |
| Cordon/fruiting wires (2) | On each cross-arm end | 9-11 high-tensile | Supports permanent cordons |
| Catch wire pairs (2-3 per curtain) | 10-12 inches apart above cordons | 12.5-14 | Positions shoots upward |

**Total wire count**: 5-7 wires per row. High-tensile galvanized steel wire performs best; use Class III zinc coating in humid climates for corrosion resistance. Maintain **250 pounds tension** on cordon wires using in-line strainers.

**Fruiting wires** at approximately **36-42 inches** on each cross-arm end support permanent cordons. Position **catch wire pairs** at 12-inch and 24-inch intervals above cordon height, with the top wire reaching **60-72 inches** above ground.

### Cost comparison

For a 100-vine installation with 8-foot spacing across three 250-foot rows:

| Item | Quantity | Estimated Cost |
|------|----------|----------------|
| End posts (5"×10') | 6 | $90-150 |
| Line posts (3"×8') | 30-35 | $180-280 |
| Cross-arms (4' steel) | 35-40 | $175-300 |
| High-tensile wire 12.5 ga (4,000 ft roll) | 1-2 | $100-200 |
| Earth anchors, strainers, gripples | Various | $130-230 |
| **Total materials** | | **$675-1,160** |

VSP installations for equivalent vine counts cost approximately **30-40% less** due to eliminated cross-arms. GDC falls between the two systems.

## Establishing the Lyre structure through years one to three

Proper establishment determines long-term success. Rushing cordon development creates permanent gaps; excessive early cropping weakens root systems. Plan for first meaningful harvest in year three, with full production by year four or five.

### First-year foundation building

**At planting (April-May, post-frost)**: Set grafted vines with graft unions 1-2 inches above final soil line. Cut back to the two strongest basal buds. Install sturdy training stakes (rolled steel or rebar preferred over bamboo) fastened to the trunk support wire.

During the first growing season, allow vines to "bush" with multiple shoots initially—this maximizes leaf area for root development. By mid-season, select 2-3 strongest shoots and tie loosely to training stakes. Target shoots should reach **pencil thickness (5/16 to 1/2 inch diameter)** with cinnamon-brown external lignification by fall. **Remove all fruit clusters**—energy must flow to roots.

**First dormant pruning (December-March)**: Weak growth (thin canes) requires cutting back to 2-4 buds for another establishment year. One strong, well-lignified cane warrants continued training toward the bifurcation point.

### Second-year trunk development

The primary goal shifts to establishing the trunk to its division height and beginning cordon formation. Continue training the primary shoot upward to reach approximately **32 inches (80 cm)**—the standard trunk division height for Lyre systems.

**How bifurcation occurs**: At the target height, the trunk terminates in a "head" region. Select **two shoots on opposite sides** to become bilateral cordons extending along each cross-arm's cordon wire. These shoots train horizontally outward in opposite directions, eventually developing spurs for fruiting.

**Critical protocol**: Develop cordons in **stepwise fashion**, laying down no more than **5-7 buds or 18 inches of cane per season**. This prevents unproductive gaps and promotes even bud break along the entire cordon length.

**Remove all fruit clusters** during year two. Maintain a **second trunk** by leaving a short spur at the vine base—insurance against winter injury that becomes particularly valuable given Lyre's extensive permanent wood structure.

### Third-year structure completion

Complete cordon extension along both parallel wires, targeting **6-8 feet of cordon per arm** (12-16 feet total bearing surface per vine depending on spacing). Position catch wires and establish spur positions equidistantly along each cordon at approximately **6-inch intervals**.

The completed Lyre architecture comprises a short trunk (~32 inches) bifurcating into a head, two arms extending to each parallel cordon wire, and bilateral cordons running in opposite directions along both wires—creating four cordon sections viewed from above.

**First crop expectations**: Year three typically produces **half to full crop** depending on trellis fill achieved. Vines filling their canopy space can be fully cropped; weaker development requires cluster thinning to prevent overcropping stress.

## Annual dormant season pruning protocols

Prune between December and March during full dormancy, ideally **late February to early March**. Late pruning reduces cold injury risk in marginal climates and allows accurate winter damage assessment before cutting decisions.

### Spur pruning technique

Lyre systems predominantly use spur pruning, though cane pruning remains possible for varieties with unfruitful basal buds. Standard spur pruning procedure:

1. Identify healthy canes from the previous season (pencil-thick, brown/cinnamon color, green internal wood)
2. Prune each cane to a **2-3 bud spur**
3. Retain spur positions that are vertical and well-situated between catch wires
4. Remove bull wood exceeding 1/2 inch diameter, weak wood thinner than pencil diameter, and any diseased material
5. Maintain renewal spurs at each position's base for next year's fruiting wood

**Both curtains require complete pruning**—work systematically through each side. Approximate labor doubles compared to single-curtain systems.

### Bud count targets

Divided canopy systems can retain higher bud counts than VSP due to improved light penetration and fruit zone distribution. Target **3-5 shoots per linear foot of canopy per curtain**.

| Vine Spacing | Cordon Length (each direction) | Buds per Curtain | Total per Vine |
|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 5 feet | 5 feet | 15-25 | 30-50 |
| 6 feet | 6 feet | 18-30 | 36-60 |
| 8 feet | 8 feet | 24-40 | 48-80 |

**Balance across curtains**: Aim for similar bud counts on both sides. Monitor vigor differences between sunny and shaded orientations, reducing buds on weaker sides and increasing on stronger performers. Spring shoot thinning to target density on **both curtains equally** completes the balancing process.

## Growing season management for both curtains

Lyre's labor demands concentrate during shoot positioning periods. Miss the timing window and shoots break; position too early and they fall back out. Plan for **2-3 positioning passes** during rapid spring growth.

### Shoot positioning fundamentals

**Initial positioning**: 1-2 weeks after bloom, before tendrils attach firmly. **Subsequent passes**: every 2-3 weeks during active growth until shoots fill catch wire capacity.

Technique: Pull catch wires to sweep shoots from the center outward into their respective curtains. Shoots must angle **10-15 degrees from vertical, directed outward** to maintain the characteristic U-shape. The goal creates two distinct vertical leaf walls with open interior space—essentially two parallel VSP configurations. Use clips or branch locks to secure wire positions.

Each curtain requires complete attention—labor approximately doubles compared to single-curtain positioning.

### Managing the interior space

The space between curtains differentiates successful Lyre from a shaded single canopy. Active maintenance proves essential:

- Remove shoots growing horizontally into the interior opening
- Redirect vigorous interior growth outward into the appropriate curtain  
- Never allow growth to close off the center opening
- Hedge interior and exterior surfaces of each curtain when shoots begin bending at 45-degree angles

**Neglected interior space** creates humidity traps, eliminates the system's primary disease resistance advantage, and negates yield/quality benefits.

### Leaf removal timing

Lyre's open structure often requires less aggressive leaf removal than dense VSP canopies. When removal proves necessary, timing significantly affects outcomes:

| Timing | Effect | Best Application |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| At bloom | Reduces fruit set, loosens clusters | Humid climates with rot pressure |
| Pea-sized berries | Allows fruit acclimation | Standard recommendation |
| Post-veraison | Higher sunburn risk | Cool climates only |

Remove **3-4 leaves per shoot** in the fruiting zone maximum. In warm climates, remove leaves only on the morning-sun side while retaining afternoon shade protection.

### Hedging requirements

Trigger hedging when shoots begin bending at approximately 45 degrees, typically between fruit set and pre-veraison. Avoid early-season hedging (stimulates lateral growth, increases density) and veraison-period hedging (delays ripening, reduces winter hardiness).

**Lyre-specific approach**: Hedge both inner and outer surfaces of each curtain. The interior requires particular attention given reduced accessibility.

## Troubleshooting the challenges divided canopies create

### Curtain dominance imbalance

When one curtain consistently outperforms the other, investigate root damage, soil variability, irrigation uniformity, or trunk disease affecting one cordon. **Solutions**: Reduce retained buds on the dominant side at pruning; increase buds on weaker performers; evaluate chronic cases for trunk renewal.

### Interior shading despite divided structure

Cross-arms too narrow, insufficient positioning passes, or excessive vigor allowing inward shoot growth all cause interior shading. **Solutions**: Increase shoot positioning frequency, implement interior hedging, remove inward-growing laterals, or assess whether site vigor exceeds Lyre system capacity entirely.

### Spray coverage difficulties

Virginia Tech research documented "poor penetration/coverage of clusters in the divided canopy trellis" promoting secondary powdery mildew lesions. The interior surfaces of both curtains present difficult targets for standard airblast sprayers.

**Solutions**: Maintain open canopy through timely leaf removal to improve spray penetration; reduce travel speed to 2.5-4 mph; increase water volume; spray both row directions for complete coverage; time applications when canopy density remains lower (earlier season).

### When complexity exceeds capacity

Warning signs that Lyre has become unmanageable: inability to complete positioning passes on schedule, canopy management costs exceeding benefits, declining quality on both curtains despite effort. The system demands **approximately 80 hours per hectare** for shoot positioning alone in divided canopy configurations.

Dr. Smart's assessment: "Its popularity waned because of problems with mechanization... There may be 6-to-12 foliage wires and two fruiting wires. It's therefore one of the more expensive trellis systems to install." When labor constraints make Lyre unsustainable, consider Scott-Henry for mechanization compatibility or VSP with aggressive management and closer spacing.

## Regional adaptations from Bordeaux to California

### Cool and humid climates

**Bordeaux (origin)**: Château Bertinerie operates France's largest Lyre vineyard at over 80 hectares, personally advised by Carbonneau. The winery reports "more air circulation means less chance of mildew throughout the season, limiting treatments necessary" while adding "fatness especially to Sauvignon Blanc" from increased photosynthetic capacity.

Cool, humid regions benefit most from Lyre's disease-resistance advantages. Doubled canopy surface area maximizes light capture during short growing seasons. However, extensive cordon development creates elevated cold injury risk—maintain multiple trunks and replacement canes in rotation.

### Moderate climates

Oregon's King Estate uses Lyre on approximately 5% of their 465-acre vineyard, specifically "as a defense against mildew by exposing grapes to more wind and sun" on fertile blocks producing excessive vegetation. White varieties like Pinot Gris receive particular benefit from the protected fruit position.

Michigan vineyards employ Lyre successfully for Cabernet Franc, exploiting the variety's strongly upright habit. Virginia operations report similar results in Mid-Atlantic humidity with attentive canopy management.

### Warm climates require caution

California's Napa Valley saw extensive Lyre installation during the 1990s phylloxera replanting era—"probably more than anywhere else in the world" according to Smart. Popularity subsequently declined due to mechanization limitations and trunk disease concerns.

**Critical warning for warm regions**: Dr. Mark Greenspan of Advanced Viticulture notes that "vertically divided trellis systems are appropriate only for cool-climate viticultural regions. In warm and hot climates the fruit zones tend to be far too exposed to direct sunlight." While Lyre's upward shoot positioning provides more fruit protection than GDC, sunburn risk remains elevated compared to standard VSP. Retain more canopy in hot climates; conduct leaf removal only on morning-sun sides during heat waves.

### American varieties and GDC comparison

For native American grapes (Vitis labrusca) and many hybrids with naturally trailing growth habits, Geneva Double Curtain remains the appropriate horizontally divided choice. Cornell Extension guidance: "Native American vines and hybrids tend to be down-growing, whereas V. vinifera varieties grow naturally upwards. The training should therefore follow the natural inclinations of the vines."

Reserve Lyre for upright-growing vinifera and those hybrids demonstrating similar erect shoot behavior.

## Conclusion: Matching system to situation

The Lyre trellis delivers exceptional results under conditions matching its design intent—high-vigor sites growing upright vinifera varieties where manual harvest poses no limitation. Château Bertinerie's 80+ hectare success in Bordeaux demonstrates commercial viability; small-scale growers following the same principles can achieve comparable results on individual plots where VSP creates unmanageable shade.

The key decision factors remain **site vigor, variety growth habit, and labor availability**. Fertile ground producing excessive vegetation benefits from canopy division. Cabernet Franc's strongly upright shoots adapt naturally to the system. Operations planning hand harvest can exploit Lyre's protected fruit zones and improved disease resistance.

Where mechanization matters, where labor constraints limit canopy management passes, or where site vigor fails to justify divided capacity, simpler alternatives—VSP with aggressive hedging, or Scott-Henry for mechanized operations—deliver adequate results with reduced complexity. The 80 hours per hectare required for Lyre's shoot positioning represents commitment many operations cannot sustain.

For the small-scale grower willing to invest that labor on appropriate sites, Lyre offers a sophisticated solution to vigor management that simpler systems cannot match. The doubled canopy surface, open interior, and protected fruit position create conditions for both quality and quantity—the combination Carbonneau sought when developing the system for Bordeaux's challenging maritime climate four decades ago.
