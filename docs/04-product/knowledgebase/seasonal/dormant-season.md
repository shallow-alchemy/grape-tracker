# Dormant season vineyard management: A practical guide for small-scale growers

**The dormant season—from leaf fall through budbreak—is when vineyard decisions most profoundly shape next year's crop.** Late pruning reduces trunk disease infection and frost damage, proper bud assessment prevents over- or under-cropping, and timely infrastructure work saves headaches when spring demands arrive. This guide organizes tasks by decision triggers rather than calendar dates, because a February task in California may be an April task in New York.

## Understanding dormancy's critical stages

Dormancy isn't static. Cold hardiness follows a **U-shaped curve**: vines acclimate slowly through fall, reach peak hardiness in mid-winter (typically January-February), then deacclimate rapidly as temperatures warm. This pattern drives every major dormant-season decision.

The key insight: **deacclimation happens faster than acclimation**. A few warm days in late winter can trigger vines to lose weeks of accumulated hardiness. Cold events following warm spells cause more damage than the same cold temperatures in mid-winter. Recognizing where your vines sit on this curve determines everything from pruning timing to spray schedules.

Four phenological stages guide dormant-season work:
- **Early dormancy** (post-leaf fall, before hard freezes): Infrastructure assessment, planning, soil testing
- **Mid-winter dormancy** (coldest period, peak hardiness): Monitoring, minimal vine disturbance in cold climates
- **Late dormancy** (warming temperatures): Primary pruning window, bud damage assessment
- **Pre-budbreak** (bud swell imminent): Final pruning cuts, dormant sprays, cover crop management

## Pruning: The defining task of dormancy

### When to prune—and why later is better

University research universally recommends **pruning as late as practical before budbreak**. UC Davis advises February or later for California; Cornell suggests completing pruning by mid-April in the Northeast; Michigan State recommends March to early April. The reasons compound:

**Trunk disease reduction**: Pruning wounds remain susceptible to fungal infection for 4-6 weeks. Spores of Eutypa, Botryosphaeria, and Esca pathogens disperse primarily during winter rain events—peaking December through January in most regions. Late pruning means wounds are made after peak spore pressure, and warmer temperatures accelerate healing. UC Davis research shows delayed pruning is "very effective in reducing the risk of infection."

**Cold hardiness preservation**: Unpruned vines maintain better cold hardiness longer into winter. In cold climates, this provides critical insurance against late-season freezes.

**Damage assessment**: Waiting allows you to evaluate winter injury before committing to final bud counts. You cannot adjust for damage you haven't yet discovered.

The practical sequence: prune **cold-hardy varieties first** (American grapes, hybrids), leaving tender vinifera varieties for last when frost risk has diminished.

### Double pruning for disease protection and frost avoidance

For spur-pruned vineyards, double pruning offers significant advantages. The first pass—done mechanically or by less-skilled labor in early winter—leaves canes 12-18 inches longer than final length. The second pass in late winter makes final 2-3 bud spurs, removing any tissue infected during the first cut.

This technique reduces trunk disease infection by **50-60%** compared to single pruning. An additional benefit: leaving extra buds delays development of basal buds through apical dominance, providing frost protection for early-budding varieties.

### Assessing bud damage before final cuts

After cold events dropping below **0°F**, or routinely before pruning in cold climates, assess bud viability:

1. Collect 10-15 representative canes (100 buds total per variety/block)
2. Allow canes to warm at room temperature for 24-48 hours
3. Use a razor blade to make cross-sectional cuts through compound buds
4. **Green tissue = alive; brown/black = dead**

Adjust pruning based on primary bud mortality:
- **0-15% damage**: Prune normally
- **15-35% damage**: Leave 25-35% more buds
- **35-50% damage**: Leave 50-100% more buds  
- **>50% damage**: Minimal pruning; wait until budbreak to assess shoot emergence

Remember that secondary buds are hardier than primaries and can produce roughly one-third of a normal crop in many hybrid varieties—more in vinifera.

### Spur versus cane pruning

**Spur pruning** (retaining 2-3 bud spurs along permanent cordons) suits varieties with fruitful basal buds—most wine grapes including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and hybrid varieties. It's simpler, requires no tying, and facilitates double pruning.

**Cane pruning** (selecting entire 8-15 bud canes annually) is necessary for varieties with low basal bud fertility: Sauvignon Blanc, Nebbiolo, and sometimes Riesling in cool climates. Select canes of pencil diameter with brown/cinnamon color and green interior.

### Calculating bud numbers

Balanced pruning considers vine vigor. Weigh the one-year-old wood removed during pruning: **0.2-0.4 pounds per linear foot of canopy** indicates proper balance. General formulas vary by variety type—French hybrids typically follow a 20+5 formula (20 buds for the first pound of prunings, plus 5 for each additional pound), while vinifera often uses 20+20.

A simpler approach: target **3-5 shoots per linear foot of canopy**, adjusting based on vine vigor and previous year's performance.

## Cold hardiness and winter injury

### Recognizing damage patterns

Different vine tissues have different vulnerabilities. **Primary buds** are least hardy and freeze first. **Roots** are extremely sensitive—damage occurs at soil temperatures of just **21-23°F**. Adequate snow cover or mulching provides critical root insulation.

Temperature thresholds for 50% bud mortality vary dramatically by variety class:
- **Very tender vinifera** (Merlot, Syrah): +5 to -5°F
- **Tender vinifera** (Chardonnay, Pinot Noir): 0 to -8°F  
- **Hardy hybrids** (Frontenac, Marquette): -20 to -30°F

### Crown gall: The cold injury connection

Crown gall, caused by the bacterium *Agrobacterium vitis*, exploits winter wounds. Cold damage creates entry points; the bacteria already present systemically then proliferates. Look for tumor-like galls at graft unions or near wound sites. Management involves training replacement trunks from healthy suckers below the infection and removing affected wood from the vineyard.

### Cold climate protection strategies

In regions where temperatures routinely drop below -15°F, additional measures are essential:

**Hilling up** covers graft unions with 3-4 inches of soil, providing insulation that can keep tissue **22°F warmer** than air temperature. Apply soil after harvest before ground freezes; remove before bud swell to prevent scion rooting.

**Multiple trunk training** provides redundancy—if one trunk suffers damage, the other maintains production while you train a replacement.

**Snow management**: Snow acts as excellent insulation. In colder regions, plowing snow against vine rows can provide protective benefits similar to hilling.

## Trunk disease management

### Why dormancy determines disease trajectory

Every California vineyard—and likely every vineyard older than 5-7 years anywhere—harbors trunk disease pathogens. But **symptoms don't appear until years after infection**. This makes prevention during dormancy critical: by the time you see stunted, cupped shoots or dead spurs, the infection has been progressing internally for years.

The major pathogens—Eutypa, Botryosphaeria, and Esca complex—enter exclusively through pruning wounds. Spores land on fresh cuts during rain events and colonize exposed tissue. Once established, infections cannot be eradicated with fungicides—they grow internally toward the trunk and roots.

### Wound protection strategies

For small-scale growers, practical wound protection includes:

**Same-day application** of wound protectants is ideal. Options include:
- **VitiSeal** (essential oil sealant): Easiest for home growers; apply with spray bottle
- **Bio-Tam 2.0 or Vintec** (Trichoderma biologicals): Colonize wounds with beneficial fungi; temperatures above 50°F improve efficacy
- **Topsin-M + Rally** combination: Chemical fungicide option; apply within 24 hours

For large pruning cuts (trunk surgery), hand-painting with **B-Lock** (5% boric acid in acrylic paint) provides effective barrier protection.

### Sanitation practices

Tool disinfection between every vine isn't necessary—airborne spread is the primary concern. Target sanitation efforts:
- After cutting obviously diseased or cankered wood
- When switching from diseased blocks to healthy blocks
- **Prune healthy blocks first**, diseased blocks last

Effective disinfectants include 70% isopropyl alcohol (spray), 10% bleach solution (dip 1-2 minutes, then oil tools), or Lysol concentrate. Keeping two sets of pruners—one soaking while the other is in use—streamlines the process.

### Removing infected wood

When cutting out trunk disease, remove wood **at least 4 inches below visible infection**—ideally 7-12 inches. Continue cutting lower if cross-sections still show discoloration. Infected wood must be **removed from the vineyard**; leaving large pieces on the ground allows continued sporulation for years. Burn, bury deeply away from vines, or hot-compost for 6+ months.

## Dormant spray applications

### Lime sulfur: The traditional dormant fungicide

Lime sulfur targets overwintering powdery mildew, Phomopsis, anthracnose, and scale insects. Apply at **10 gallons per acre** (approximately 4 gallons per 100 gallons of spray mix) **before any green tissue is visible**—bud swell is acceptable, green tip is not.

**Critical safety notes**: Lime sulfur is caustic; wear eye protection, gloves, and long sleeves. Do not apply to sulfur-sensitive varieties (Maréchal Foch, Leon Millot). Never apply within 30 days of an oil spray.

### Dormant oil applications

Horticultural oil smothers overwintering mites, scale insects, and aphid eggs. Apply at **2-4% concentration** when temperatures will remain above 40°F for 24 hours. Time applications as close to budbreak as possible—insects begin active respiration as temperatures warm.

**Never combine oil with lime sulfur**—the mixture causes severe phytotoxicity.

### Application timing window

The "delayed dormant" window—bud swell before green tissue emergence—is optimal for most dormant sprays. Monitor vine phenology closely in late winter; once buds show green tip, lime sulfur applications must cease. Copper can be applied through green tip with caution.

## Infrastructure and planning during dormancy

### Trellis maintenance

With no canopy obstructing the view, dormancy is ideal for trellis assessment. Check:
- **Wire tension**: Target approximately 250 lbs; wires stretch and require annual tensioning
- **Post integrity**: Look for rot at ground level, leaning, or structural failure
- **End posts and anchors**: Anchors can lift depending on soil type; ensure equal tension with fruiting wires
- **Catch wires and clips**: Verify foliage wires move freely; replace worn tie materials

Complete repairs before spring when pruning and tying demand attention.

### Vine ordering and planning

**Order vines 6-12 months before planting**. Waiting until January or February creates availability and quality problems. Order 10% more than needed for replants. Request virus-tested, certified vines from reputable nurseries.

**Soil testing** is most reliable during dormancy when nutrient levels are stable. Sample at 0-8 inch depth from 10-15 subsamples per area. Test every 3-5 years for established vineyards; adjust amendments based on results, applying phosphorus and potassium during dormancy for slow-moving nutrient uptake.

### Equipment and spray program preparation

Winter is the time to service equipment, sharpen pruning tools, and plan next season's spray program. Review previous season records to identify recurring problems and adjust chemical rotation to prevent resistance (limit single-mode-of-action fungicides to twice per season per FRAC group).

## Cover crop and soil management

### Late winter cover crop decisions

Mow winter cover crops **just before they transition from dormant rosette stage into flowering**—typically late February through March in temperate zones. Tall cover crops impede air movement and increase frost risk; keep vegetation below 18 inches near budbreak.

**Terminate cover crops 3-5 weeks before budbreak** to reduce early water and nutrient competition. Vigorous vineyards may benefit from maintained competition; young vineyards need protection from it.

### Drainage assessment and erosion control

Walk the vineyard during and after winter rains to identify wet spots, pooling, and erosion patterns. Vines tolerate brief standing water during dormancy when respiration rates are minimal, but prolonged waterlogging damages root systems. Note areas with mottled yellowish-brown soil coloring—indicating persistent high water tables—for remediation.

## Monitoring through winter

### Rodent damage prevention

Voles gnaw bark at or below ground level, often concealed by grass, mulch, or snow. Damage increases when food is scarce during prolonged snow cover. Install **hardware cloth cylinders** (1/4-inch mesh, 18-24 inches high, buried 6 inches) before winter. Check protection after heavy snows to ensure it extends above snowpack.

### Tracking conditions for budbreak prediction

Growing degree days (GDD) accumulate from temperatures above 50°F. Many varieties break bud after 100-200 GDD accumulated from January 1 or April 1, depending on tracking system. Earlier warm spells can trigger premature budbreak, increasing frost risk. Local extension services often provide real-time bud hardiness monitoring—Cornell's program is particularly valuable for Eastern growers.

## Connecting dormant decisions to spring outcomes

Every dormant-season action reverberates through the growing year. **Pruning severity determines vigor and crop load**—leave too few buds and excessive shoot vigor creates disease-prone canopies; leave too many and overcropping depletes carbohydrate reserves, reducing next winter's cold hardiness. **Trunk disease infections** made this winter won't show symptoms for years, but preventive practices now extend vineyard lifespan by decades. **Cold damage assessment** informs whether you're managing for a normal crop or vine recovery.

For small-scale growers with limited time, prioritize:
1. **Late pruning** (the single most impactful practice)
2. **Wound protection** on large cuts
3. **Bud damage assessment** after severe cold
4. **Trellis repair** before spring demands arrive
5. **Pruning debris removal**, especially from blocks with disease history

The dormant season appears quiet, but decisions made now—or neglected—determine whether spring brings a balanced, healthy vineyard or a cascade of problems. Master dormancy management, and the growing season largely takes care of itself.
