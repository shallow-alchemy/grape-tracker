# Vineyard management from veraison through harvest

**The six to eight weeks between veraison and harvest represent the critical window where wine quality is made or lost.** This period demands attentive observation, timely intervention, and restrained action—knowing when *not* to act matters as much as knowing when to intervene. For small-scale and home vineyard growers, success hinges on understanding the physiological changes driving ripening and aligning management decisions with each phenological stage rather than arbitrary calendar dates.

Stephen Skelton, in his authoritative "Viticulture" textbook, emphasizes that "a long, slow ripening, and late harvest, achieves the finest wines." This principle should guide every decision during this period: create conditions that allow steady, unhurried ripening while protecting fruit from the accumulating threats of rot, pests, and weather.

## What happens inside the berry at veraison

Veraison marks a profound metabolic shift triggered primarily by **abscisic acid (ABA)**, which surges as auxin levels decline. This hormonal switch initiates berry softening, sugar accumulation, and—in red varieties—anthocyanin synthesis. The softening actually precedes sugar loading by several days, as turgor pressure drops and cell walls loosen. Understanding this sequence helps explain why grapes feel soft before refractometer readings climb significantly.

At veraison onset (E-L stage 35), berries typically measure just **6-8°Brix**. Malic acid concentrations peak near **25 g/L**—explaining the intensely sour taste of unripe grapes. Over the following weeks, phloem transport delivers sugars while respiratory metabolism burns through malic acid, particularly at temperatures above 30°C. In cool climates, this acid degradation proceeds slowly, often leaving wines with characteristically bright acidity. Warm-region growers face the opposite challenge: malic acid disappearing faster than flavors develop.

The lag phase preceding veraison deserves attention. During these two to three weeks of apparent inactivity, seeds complete embryo development and tannin synthesis reaches its peak. Any severe stress during this period—water deficit, defoliation, disease—can disrupt the transition to ripening and cause uneven veraison that persists through harvest.

## Managing the canopy as ripening begins

Canopy management during ripening requires restraint. **The critical window for leaf removal closes at veraison**—leaves removed after color change exposes previously shaded fruit to sunburn risk within minutes when berry surface temperatures exceed 40°C (104°F). Berries acclimate to light exposure over approximately seven days, but only if exposure begins well before veraison.

For small-scale growers who missed earlier leaf removal, proceed cautiously: remove leaves only on the morning-sun side (east side of north-south rows), target just the leaves directly obscuring clusters, and never remove more than two to four leaves per shoot. In humid Eastern climates, disease pressure often justifies more aggressive defoliation despite some sunburn risk; in hot Western regions, conservative removal protects against heat damage.

Final hedging passes should be completed before or shortly after veraison. Later hedging stimulates lateral growth that competes with ripening fruit. More importantly, excessive shoot trimming late in the season removes the photosynthetic capacity needed for sugar accumulation and proper vine hardening before winter. If shoots are flopping into the fruit zone and blocking spray coverage, a light trim may be necessary—but view this as correction for earlier management gaps, not standard practice.

## Water management during the ripening window

Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) during ripening can enhance fruit quality by concentrating flavors, improving skin-to-pulp ratios, and moderating excessive vigor. The target is **mild to moderate stress**, which manifests as slowed shoot growth, tendril tips wilting slightly in afternoon heat, and midday leaf water potential readings between **-12 and -14 bars**.

Small-scale growers without pressure chamber equipment can assess vine water status through careful observation: actively growing shoot tips with green, curling tendrils indicate adequate water; brown, desiccated tendrils and morning leaf wilting signal excessive stress. The "shovel test"—digging six to eight inches near the vine row to assess soil moisture—provides useful ground-truth information.

**Resume moderate irrigation at veraison onset** to support sugar loading, applying roughly 50-60% of full vine water demand through harvest. Severe post-veraison deficit delays sugar accumulation, impairs flavor development, and compromises return fruitfulness for the following season. The goal is controlled stress that slows vegetative growth while maintaining photosynthetic function.

Rain events approaching harvest present difficult decisions. Good canopy airflow accelerates drying and reduces rot pressure—another reason earlier leaf removal pays dividends. After significant rain, scout immediately for berry splitting and rot development. If harvest is imminent and splitting occurs, the decision often becomes "harvest now" rather than waiting for target numbers that may never arrive.

## Protecting fruit from late-season diseases

**Botrytis bunch rot** pressure increases dramatically after veraison as berries soften and sugar accumulates. The fungus overwinters on canes and mummies, infects during bloom, then remains latent until ripening triggers activation. This biology explains why season-long management matters: if early-season control failed, late-season fungicides face an uphill battle.

Leaf removal at fruit set remains the single most effective botrytis prevention practice—comparable to fungicides in many trials. Open canopies dry faster after rain, receive better spray coverage, and develop thicker berry cuticles that resist infection. For growers needing fungicide applications approaching harvest, products like Elevate (fenhexamid) and Switch (cyprodinil + fludioxonil) offer short pre-harvest intervals of zero and seven days respectively.

**Sour rot** presents a more complex challenge requiring different management. This isn't a single disease but a syndrome requiring damaged berries, yeasts, acetic acid bacteria, and fruit flies working together. The distinctive vinegar smell indicates damage has already occurred. Prevention centers on maintaining berry skin integrity—controlling birds with netting at veraison, managing grape berry moth, and promptly removing any damaged clusters. When conditions favor sour rot, applications combining an insecticide (for flies) with an antimicrobial (potassium metabisulfite or Oxidate) starting at 12-15°Brix offer the best results.

Late-season powdery mildew on leaves and canes deserves attention even though fruit susceptibility declines after early veraison. Infections forming now produce the overwintering structures (cleistothecia) that fuel next year's epidemic. Continue protecting leaves through September with materials like Quintec, Vivando, or potassium bicarbonate products, but **stop sulfur applications at veraison**—residues can cause hydrogen sulfide problems during fermentation.

## When and how to thin the crop

The optimal window for green harvest runs from lag phase through approximately **25% color change** in red varieties. Dr. Nick Dokoozlian's UC Davis research demonstrates that thinning at veraison avoids the berry size compensation that undermines earlier thinning: "If you thin at veraison, it is too late for the vine to compensate through berry size."

Calculate crop load targets using the Ravaz Index (yield divided by pruning weight), targeting a ratio of **5-10**. Below 5 indicates under-cropping that drives excessive vigor and can produce green, herbaceous wines. Above 10 signals overcropping that delays ripening and stresses vines. A simpler rule: maintain **16-18 leaves per cluster** for adequate carbohydrate supply.

Signs of overcropping include clusters failing to fully color, Brix plateauing below targets, extended hang time without quality improvement, and leaves senescing early in fall. However, research consistently shows that vintage conditions matter more than crop level—a well-managed moderate crop in a good year often outperforms an aggressively thinned crop in a poor one.

At 90% veraison, make a final pass to remove any remaining green or pink clusters that lagged behind. These unripe clusters won't catch up and will dilute overall quality. Also remove any clusters showing rot, severe millerandage, or bird damage—damaged fruit becomes the entry point for rot organisms.

## Tracking ripeness through systematic sampling

Begin sampling when berries reach approximately **15°Brix** or weekly after veraison, whichever comes first. Sample 100-200 berries per block, selecting randomly without looking at the clusters—visual selection biases toward riper, more attractive berries. Walk a consistent route through the vineyard, sampling from both sides of rows and varying positions within clusters.

**Critical sampling principle**: track trends over time rather than fixating on single measurements. Record Brix, pH, and observations weekly, increasing frequency to twice weekly when approaching target ranges, then daily in the final week.

For small-scale growers, an ATC refractometer ($25-50) and systematic taste assessment can guide excellent harvest decisions. Adding a quality pH meter ($50-150) provides critical information for wine stability. Titratable acidity test kits ($15-25) complete the picture but matter less than pH for most applications.

Variety-specific harvest targets provide starting points rather than rigid rules:

- **White varieties**: 20-24°Brix, pH 3.0-3.3, TA 7-9 g/L
- **Red varieties**: 22-26°Brix, pH 3.2-3.5, TA 6-8 g/L
- **Balance indicator**: Brix-to-TA ratio of 30-35:1

**Taste assessment matters as much as numbers.** Systematically evaluate berry sweetness, skin tannin texture (smooth versus gritty), seed hardness and flavor (green versus toasty), and overall aromatic development. Ripe berries separate easily from pedicels, skins disintegrate when chewed, and seeds crack audibly when bitten. The progression from green/herbaceous through fresh fruit to jammy/dried fruit flavors helps identify your position in the ripeness window.

## Making the harvest call

Technological ripeness—the winemaker's target—varies with vintage, style goals, and market expectations. Unlike physiological maturity (the moment seeds can germinate), technological maturity represents a judgment about when flavor, sugar, acid, and phenolic development align for your intended wine style.

The harvest window for most varieties spans **one to two weeks** of optimal quality, though this narrows significantly with heat events, rain, or disease pressure. Cool climates typically see ripeness achieved around 70 days after veraison; hot climates may reach targets in 30 days.

**Signs of overripeness** include berry shriveling and raisining (especially in Syrah and Zinfandel), pH climbing above 3.5 for reds, jammy or baked fruit flavors replacing fresh fruit character, and loss of varietal definition. Waiting for "perfect" numbers while overripeness develops represents a common mistake—when conditions are right, act decisively.

Integrate weather forecasting into harvest planning. When grapes approach optimal ripeness and significant rain is forecast, harvesting before rain typically produces better results than waiting. Have equipment cleaned and help arranged two weeks before anticipated harvest; know your contingency plan for different weather scenarios.

## Bird and wildlife pressure intensifies at veraison

Birds discover ripening grapes precisely when you'd prefer they didn't—at veraison. **Install netting at the first signs of color change**, not after damage appears. For small vineyards, side netting (deployed along row sides rather than over the top) uses less material, allows continued spray access, and can remain in place year-round, simply rolled up after harvest.

Quality bird netting represents one of the best investments for small-scale growers. Budget approximately $0.05-0.15 per square foot for netting that will last multiple seasons. Heavier knitted nets cost more initially but tolerate handling better than lightweight extruded plastic.

Yellow jackets present a different challenge: they damage berries directly and spread sour rot organisms between clusters. Locate and destroy nests before harvest season, deploy traps with protein bait (late summer) or sugar bait, and recognize that heavy wasp activity indicates elevated sour rot risk requiring vigilant scouting.

## From veraison to harvest: the decision timeline

**At veraison onset**: Stop leaf removal; install bird netting; resume moderate irrigation; begin weekly sampling; make final pass to remove green clusters; scout for existing disease issues.

**Mid-ripening (12-18°Brix)**: Continue sampling; monitor water stress; apply botrytis fungicide if rain forecast; manage sour rot if conditions favor it; note any uneven ripening.

**Approaching targets (18-22+°Brix)**: Increase sampling frequency; conduct systematic taste assessments; confirm harvest help and equipment availability; monitor weather forecasts daily; apply final fungicides within PHI windows.

**Harvest decision**: Act when flavor assessment, numbers, and logistics align—perfect conditions rarely persist. Sample immediately post-harvest if any fruit remains; resume full irrigation to support vine recovery and carbohydrate storage.

The period from veraison through harvest rewards attentive growers who understand what's happening inside their vines and respond appropriately to each phenological stage. Numbers guide decisions, but observation and taste ultimately determine quality. Keep records comparing Brix, pH, TA, and tasting notes across vintages to learn your vineyard's particular rhythms—this knowledge, accumulated over seasons, becomes your most valuable harvest tool.
