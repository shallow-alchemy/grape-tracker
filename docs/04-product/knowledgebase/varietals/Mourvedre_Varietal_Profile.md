## Climate Requirements

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Optimal GDD (°C-days) | **1,945-2,222** | Highest of Rhône varieties |
| Winkler Region | **IV (Hot)** | Requires warmest sites |
| Heat Requirement | **Very High** | — |
| Drought Tolerance | Moderate | — |

**Critical:** Mourvèdre demands the most heat of any Rhône variety. Bandol's growing season runs 5°C warmer than Châteauneuf-du-Pape for reliable ripening. Requires **180+ frost-free days**.

### Critical Temperature Thresholds

| Threshold | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------|
| Photosynthesis Shutdown | >38°C (100°F) |
| Dormant LT50 | -15 to -18°C |
| Bud Frost Damage | <0°C (32°F) |

---

## Phenology

**Budbreak Order:** Late (natural frost avoidance). Budbreak occurs 13 days after Chasselas.

### Harvest Timing

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Typical Harvest | **Mid-October to November** |
| Days Bloom→Harvest | **115-130+** |
| Target Brix | 24-27° |
| Target pH | 3.4-3.7 |

**Critical:** Mourvèdre ripens last among Rhône varieties, sometimes 4.5 weeks after reference varieties.

### Phenological GDD Thresholds (base 10°C)

| Stage | GDD |
|-------|-----|
| Budbreak | Late (+13 days) |
| Flowering | **409** |
| Veraison | Variable |
| Maturity | 1,945-2,222 |

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery Mildew | Moderate-High | — |
| Downy Mildew | Moderate-High | — |
| Botrytis | **Low** | Thick skins provide resistance |
| Eutypa | Susceptible | — |
| Special Concerns | — | **Mites, leafhoppers, esca** |

**Advantage:** Thick skins provide botrytis resistance, beneficial for late-harvest situations.

### Disease Management Summary

- **Spray Intensity:** Moderate
- **Primary Concern:** Mites, leafhoppers
- **Secondary Concern:** Esca, sour rot

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor and Training

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Vigor | Low-Moderate |
| Preferred Training | Gobelet, head |
| Growth Habit | **Upright** |
| Crop Load (tons/acre) | **<2.5** |

### Canopy Management

| Task | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Shoot Thinning | Avoid over-trimming |
| Leaf Removal | **Caution** (sunburn risk) |
| Cluster Thinning | Rarely needed |
| Overall Intensity | Low-Moderate |

**Critical:** Mourvèdre requires minimal canopy intervention. Its limited foliage and tendency toward sunburn mean excessive trimming harms quality.

### Rootstock Recommendations

| Category | Rootstocks |
|----------|------------|
| Primary | **110R, 41B** |
| Alternative | 161-49C, 140Ru |
| Drought-Tolerant | 110R |

**Research Note:** Spanish studies found low-vigor rootstocks (110R, 161-49C) produce wines with higher polyphenols, anthocyanins, and color intensity.

## Winemaking Profile

### Oxidation/Reduction Tendency

- **Tendency:** **Highly reductive**
- **Management:** Requires oxygen exposure; frequent racking; micro-oxygenation beneficial (20-60 mg/L/month pre-MLF)

This reductive character makes Mourvèdre complementary to oxidation-prone Grenache in GSM blends.

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Brix | 24-27° |
| pH | 3.4-3.7 |
| TA (g/L) | 5-7 |

**Special Note:** High-pH variety; acid addition often needed.

### Fermentation Parameters

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Temperature | 75-86°F (24-30°C) |
| Skin Contact | ~10 days |
| Whole Cluster | Traditional in Bandol |
| Oak Preference | **Neutral only** |

**Critical:** Mourvèdre does not absorb oak flavors well. Neutral oak or large format essential.

### Aging Potential

| Level | Window |
|-------|--------|
| Standard | 8-12 years |
| Premium | **15+ years** |

**Note:** Mourvèdre has a characteristic 4-8 year "closed period" before opening up.

## Blending Role

### GSM Contribution

- **Primary Contribution:** Structure, tannin, earthiness
- **Sensory Impact:** Meaty, leathery, finish length

### Traditional Blend Ratios

| Style | Mourvèdre % |
|-------|-------------|
| Southern Rhône | 10-30% |
| Châteauneuf-du-Pape | ~6.6% of plantings |
| **Bandol red (AOC)** | **50-95% (minimum required)** |

Bandol is the benchmark for Mourvèdre-dominant wines.

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Cool | *Struggles* — green, harsh tannins |
| Moderate | Cherry, medium body; better for blending |
| Warm/Hot | **Meaty, gamey**, blackberry, leather; deep purple |

**Critical:** Mourvèdre should only be planted in the warmest available sites. Cool-climate attempts typically fail to achieve physiological ripeness.

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Advantages

- Upright growth allows bush training without trellis
- Low botrytis susceptibility for late harvest
- Excellent aging potential
- Minimal canopy work required

### Challenges

- **Requires hottest sites** — may not ripen in marginal climates
- Very late harvest (frost risk in some regions)
- Multiple harvest passes often needed
- Limited single-varietal appeal in US market

### Beginner Accessibility

**Rating:** 6 — **Not Recommended for Beginners**

Mourvèdre's extreme heat requirements make it unsuitable for most small-scale growers unless in proven hot microclimates. Failure to ripen is the primary risk.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Heat:** HIGHEST requirement of Rhône varieties — hot sites only
2. **Ripening:** VERY late — 180+ frost-free days required
3. **Vigor:** Low — minimal canopy intervention needed
4. **Winemaking:** HIGHLY reductive — needs oxygen exposure
5. **Oak:** Neutral only — does not absorb flavors well
6. **Aging:** Long-lived but has 4-8 year closed period
7. **Blending:** Provides structure/tannin to GSM; balances Grenache's oxidation
