## Climate Requirements

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Minimum GDD | ~2,500°F | Marginal |
| Optimal GDD | 2,500–3,500°F (Region II–III) | Flexible range |

| Post-budbreak frost (serious) | 23°F (-5°C) | Significant damage |

---

## Phenology

| Stage | GDD (base 50°F) | Relative Timing |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Bud break | ~120 GDD | Early — just after Chardonnay |
| Flowering | ~60 days from bud break | Temperature dependent |
| Veraison | 45–50 days after bloom | Earlier than Cab Sauv |
| Harvest | 100–120 days from bloom | 2 weeks earlier than Cab Sauv |

**Harvest order (Bordeaux reds):** Merlot (EARLIEST) → Cabernet Franc → Cabernet Sauvignon

### Ripeness Indicators

- Brix: 23–25.5°
- Seeds: Brown (green seeds = bitter tannins in wine)
- Berry color: Deep purple-black, uniform
- Flavor: Ripe plum, no green/vegetal notes
- Berry texture: Soft, easily crushable

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery mildew | Low–Moderate | Less susceptible than Cab Franc and Cab Sauv |
| Downy mildew | HIGH | Particularly sensitive on flowers and bunches |
| Botrytis | HIGH | Thin skins, tight clusters, dense canopies |
| Coulure | HIGH | Major variety-specific issue |
| Crown gall | HIGH | Exacerbated by cold injury |
| Phylloxera | HIGH | Requires grafting |

### Coulure Management

Coulure (poor fruit set) is a major concern for Merlot. Normal fruit set is 30–50%; below 30% indicates a problem.

**Contributing factors:**
- Cool, wet, windy conditions during bloom
- Molybdenum deficiency
- Excessive nitrogen
- Vigorous rootstocks

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Use rootstocks that don't promote coulure (SO4, Teleki 5C)
- Balanced nitrogen fertilization
- Foliar boron and zinc applications at bloom
- Avoid excessive vigor

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor Characteristics

- **Rating:** Medium–High
- **Growth habit:** Trailing, creates dense canopy
- **Canopy density:** High — prone to shading
- **Water sensitivity:** HIGH — shallow root system; sensitive to both drought and waterlogging

### Spacing Guidelines

| Site Type | Row Width | Vine Spacing | Vines/Acre |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Standard | 6–8 ft (1.8–2.4 m) | 3–6 ft (1–2 m) | 900–2,400 |
| High vigor | 8–10 ft | 4–6 ft | 725–1,350 |

### Training System Compatibility

| System | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| VSP | Good | Most common choice |
| Bilateral cordon | Good | Ease of management |
| Divided canopy | Excellent | Recommended for humid regions |
| Lyre | Good | Improves air circulation |

### Crop Load Targets

| Production Level | Tons/Acre | Lbs/Vine |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| Commercial | 3–5 | 12–20 |
| Premium | 2–4 | 8–16 |
| Small-scale | — | 6–12 |

### Canopy Management Calendar

| Timing | Task | Priority |
|--------|------|----------|
| Early shoot growth | Shoot thinning | High |
| Fruit set (BBCH 71–75) | Leaf removal | CRITICAL — reduces botrytis 50–80% |
| Post-fruit set | Cluster thinning | High (reduce tight clusters) |
| Throughout season | Hedging | Medium–High |
| Pre-veraison | Additional leaf pulling for airflow | High |

## Rootstock Pairings

| Rootstock | Best Use Case | Vigor Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 101-14 Mgt | High vigor soils | Low–Moderate |
| 3309C | General, moderate vigor | Low–Moderate |
| Schwarzmann | High vigor soils | Low |
| 420A | High vigor soils | Low–Moderate |
| SO4 | Coulure mitigation | Moderate |
| Teleki 5C | Coulure mitigation | Moderate |

**Avoid:** Rupestris du Lot and extremely vigorous rootstocks that promote coulure.

## Blending Compatibility

### Role in Blends

Merlot contributes softness, mid-palate fruit (plum, black cherry), roundness, and earlier drinkability. It smooths the angular tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon.

### Classic Combinations

| Blend Style | Merlot % | Partners | Notes |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Left Bank Bordeaux | 15–35% | Cab Sauv dominant | Softening agent |
| Right Bank Bordeaux | 70–100% | Cab Franc 10–30% | Dominant variety |
| Pomerol style | 80–100% | Cab Franc minor | Château Pétrus, Le Pin |
| California Meritage | 20–40% | Variable | Mid-palate flesh |

### What It Contributes

- Softness and approachability
- Plum and black cherry fruit
- Mid-palate weight
- Reduced aging requirement
- Roundness to angular blends

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate Zone | Fruit Character | Structure | Alcohol | Risks |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Cool | Red cherry, raspberry, violet | Higher acidity, lighter body | 12–13% | Bell pepper if underripe |
| Moderate | Ripe plum, black cherry, chocolate | Balanced, supple tannins | 13–14% | — |
| Warm/Hot | Jammy black fruit, prune, fig | Low acidity, very soft tannins | 14–15%+ | Flabby, lacking structure |

### Signature Aromatics

- **Primary:** Plum, black cherry, raspberry (cool climate)
- **Secondary:** Chocolate, mocha, vanilla (oak influence)
- **Tertiary (aged):** Truffle, dried fruit, earth, tobacco

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Parameter | Target Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Brix | 23–25.5° | Higher sugar at comparable ripeness to Cab Sauv |
| pH | 3.2–3.4 | |
| TA | 6.5–8.0 g/L | |

### Fermentation Parameters

| Stage | Parameter | Range |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Cold soak (optional) | Temperature | 45–55°F (7–13°C) |
| Cold soak | Duration | 2–5 days |
| Primary fermentation | Temperature | 82–86°F (28–30°C) |
| Skin contact (standard) | Duration | 7–14 days |
| Skin contact (extended) | Duration | 21–28 days |

### Oak Treatment

| Level | New Oak % | Toast | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Entry | 0–20% | Light–Medium | 6–10 months |
| Premium | 20–40% | Medium | 8–12 months |
| Ultra-premium | 40–100% | Medium | 14–18 months |

### MLF Recommendation

**Recommended** — Standard practice for red Merlot; softens malic acid.

### Aging Potential

| Wine Level | Drink Window |
|------------|--------------|
| Entry/commercial | 2–5 years |
| Premium | 8–15 years |
| Top Bordeaux (Pétrus, etc.) | 20–40+ years |

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Advantages for Home Growers

- Ripens earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon — suits shorter seasons
- Produces drinkable wine younger
- Softer tannins require less aging
- Versatile in blends

### Challenges for Home Growers

- High botrytis susceptibility demands vigilance
- Coulure risk can devastate yields
- Thin skins — handle fruit carefully
- Dense canopy needs consistent management
- Less cold-hardy than Cab Franc

### Practical Tips

1. **Canopy management is critical:** Remove leaves at fruit zone early to prevent botrytis
2. **Watch bloom conditions:** Cool, wet bloom = coulure risk — consider supplemental pollination techniques
3. **Harvest timing:** Don't wait too long — Merlot over-ripens quickly in warm weather
4. **Handle gently:** Thin skins break easily, leading to oxidation
5. **Blend if needed:** 15–20% Cabernet can add needed structure

### Yield Expectations (Mature Vines)

- **Realistic small-scale:** 6–12 lbs/vine
- **Wine yield:** ~1 gallon per 15–18 lbs fruit
- **10-vine planting:** 4–8 gallons finished wine
- **Coulure years:** Yields may drop 50–75%
