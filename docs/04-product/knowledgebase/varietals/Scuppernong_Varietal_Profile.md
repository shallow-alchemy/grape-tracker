## Species Context: Vitis rotundifolia

Scuppernong belongs to *Vitis rotundifolia*, the muscadine grape:

| Characteristic | Muscadine (Scuppernong) | Bunch Grapes |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Chromosome count | 40 | 38 |
| Cluster type | Loose, 4–15 berries | Tight bunches |
| Berry size | Large | Small to medium |
| Skin thickness | Very thick | Thin to moderate |
| Pierce's disease | IMMUNE | Susceptible to tolerant |
| Native range | Southeastern US | Europe/Eastern NA |

### Nomenclature Note

While "Scuppernong" technically refers to this specific cultivar, the term is commonly used throughout the South as a generic name for any bronze-colored muscadine. Technically:
- **Scuppernong:** The specific historic cultivar
- **Bronze muscadine:** General category including Carlos, Magnolia, Triumph, etc.

All Scuppernongs are muscadines, but not all muscadines are Scuppernongs.

## Phenology

| Stage | Timing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Bud break | Late spring | Later than bunch grapes |
| Flowering | Late spring/early summer | Female flowers only |
| Pollination | Requires pollinator vine | Critical planning factor |

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Pierce's disease | IMMUNE | Complete resistance |
| Downy mildew | MODERATE | Some susceptibility |
| Powdery mildew | LOW | Generally resistant |
| Black rot | MODERATE | Monitor in wet years |
| Bitter rot | MODERATE–HIGH | More susceptible than some cultivars |
| Phylloxera | VERY LOW | Strong resistance |

**Bitter rot note:** Scuppernong is more susceptible to bitter rot than improved cultivars like Carlos and Noble.

---

## Pollination: Critical Requirement

### Flower Type: Female (Pistillate)

Unlike Carlos and Noble, Scuppernong has only female flowers and **cannot produce fruit without a nearby pollinator**. This is the single most important planning consideration.

### Pollination Requirements

| Factor | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Pollinator type | Perfect-flowered cultivar |
| Distance | Within 25–50 ft |
| Ratio | 1 pollinator per 5–6 female vines |
| Timing | Must bloom simultaneously |

### Suitable Pollinators

| Cultivar | Flower Type | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Carlos | Perfect | Industry standard pollinator |
| Noble | Perfect | Red/perfect-flowered option |
| Magnolia | Perfect | Good pollinator |
| Triumph | Perfect | Early blooming |
| Tara | Perfect | Alternative option |

### Pollination Planning Example

A small Scuppernong planting might include:
- 4–5 Scuppernong vines (female)
- 1 Carlos or Noble vine (perfect-flowered pollinator)
- Pollinator positioned centrally or upwind

**Critical:** Without a pollinator, Scuppernong vines will grow vigorously but produce zero fruit.

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor Characteristics

- **Rating:** High
- **Growth pattern:** Vigorous, spreading vines
- **Productivity:** Good when properly pollinated
- **Lifespan:** Exceptionally long (centuries possible)

### Spacing Guidelines

| Configuration | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Minimum vine spacing | 10 ft (3 m) |
| Recommended spacing | 20 ft (6 m) |
| Trellis height | 5–6 ft (1.5–1.8 m) |

### Training Systems

| System | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Single overhead wire | Excellent | Traditional, simplest |
| Two-wire vertical | Good | Better air circulation |
| Overhead arbors | Poor | Difficult to maintain |

### Pruning Requirements

**Timing:** Late winter (February–March)

**Method:** Spur pruning to 2–3 buds, same as other muscadines.

**Essential:** Heavy annual pruning required for production.

## Flavor Profile

### Fresh Fruit

- Large bronze berries (greenish to golden when ripe)
- Sweet, distinctly musky/floral flavor
- Very thick skin
- Juicy pulp
- Stronger "muscadine" flavor than Carlos

### Wine Characteristics

- Sweet, aromatic muscadine character
- Pronounced musky/floral notes
- Best suited to sweet styles
- Traditional southern wine grape

### Fresh Eating

Scuppernong is better suited to fresh eating than Carlos:
- Larger berries
- Sweeter flavor
- Popular for U-pick operations

**Limitation:** Wet stem scar (where berry attaches to cluster) reduces shelf life for retail sales.

## Primary Uses

| Use | Quality | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Fresh eating | Good | U-pick favorite |
| Sweet wine | Good | Traditional style |
| Juice | Good | — |
| Jams/jellies | Good | Traditional southern preserves |
| Commercial wine | Moderate | Carlos preferred for processing |

### Historic Use: Virginia Dare Wine

Scuppernong was the base grape for Virginia Dare, one of America's first iconic wine brands in the early 20th century. The Paul Garrett Wine Company marketed Virginia Dare nationally, making it one of the most recognized wines in pre-Prohibition America.

## Historic Significance

### The Mother Vine

On Roanoke Island, North Carolina, grows a Scuppernong vine believed to be approximately **400 years old**—possibly the oldest cultivated grapevine in the world.

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Location | Manteo, Roanoke Island, NC |
| Estimated age | ~400 years |
| Peak size (1950s) | Nearly 2 acres coverage |
| Current size (2010) | 118 ft long × 30 ft wide |
| Status | Protected landmark |

### Discovery and Naming

- **Before 1760:** Isaac Alexander selected bronze muscadine from wild vines in Tyrrell County, NC
- **Original name:** "Big White Grape"
- **Later named:** Scuppernong, after the Scuppernong River area where found
- **1524:** Giovanni de Verrazzano noted wild grapes along Cape Fear River Valley

### State Recognition

Scuppernong is the **official state fruit of North Carolina**, reflecting its deep cultural significance in the region.

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Why Grow Scuppernong

- Historic American cultivar with cultural significance
- Better fresh-eating quality than Carlos
- Distinctive musky-sweet flavor
- Traditional southern wine grape
- Exceptionally long-lived vines
- Disease resistant in appropriate climate

### Challenges

- **Requires pollinator**—critical planning factor
- Moderate cold hardiness (less than Carlos)
- Wet stem scar limits storage/retail
- More disease susceptibility than improved cultivars
- Cannot be grown outside Zone 7–9

### Planning Checklist

1. ☐ Confirm location is Zone 7 or warmer
2. ☐ Plan pollinator vine(s)—1 per 5–6 Scuppernong
3. ☐ Allow 10–20 ft spacing per vine
4. ☐ Build sturdy trellis before planting
5. ☐ Identify harvest use (fresh, wine, jam)

### Practical Tips

1. **Pollinator first**—plant Carlos or Noble before or with Scuppernong
2. **Position pollinator strategically**—central or upwind
3. **Plan for fresh use**—wet stem scar limits storage
4. **Expect sweet wine**—Scuppernong is best semi-sweet to sweet
5. **Celebrate history**—you're growing America's oldest cultivated grape

| Wine production | Traditional/sweet | Industry standard |
| Muskiness | Higher | Lower |
| Cold hardiness | Moderate | Best |
| Disease resistance | Moderate | Good |
| Historic status | Oldest US cultivar | Modern breeding |
| Stem scar | Wet | Wet |

### When to Choose Scuppernong vs. Carlos

**Choose Scuppernong if:**
- You value historic/heritage varieties
- Primary goal is fresh eating or U-pick
- You can accommodate pollinator requirements
- You prefer traditional musky muscadine flavor
- Southern cultural significance matters

**Choose Carlos if:**
- You want simpler vineyard planning (self-fertile)
- Primary goal is wine/juice production
- You prefer milder muscadine flavor
- Maximum cold hardiness needed
- Commercial viability is priority
