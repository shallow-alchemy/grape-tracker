## Vineyard Management

### Vigor Characteristics

- **Rating:** HIGH — "Very vigorous variety"
- **Canopy density:** Dense; requires intensive management
- **Shoot growth:** Aggressive; multiple hedging passes required
- **Pyrazine concern:** Shaded canopies increase herbaceous character

### Spacing Guidelines

| Site Type | Row Width | Vine Spacing | Vines/Acre |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Standard | 8–10 ft | 4–6 ft | 725–1,350 |
| High vigor | 9–10 ft minimum | 6–8 ft | 545–800 |

### Training System Compatibility

| System | Suitability | Yield Potential | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| VSP | Good | 3–4 tons/acre | Standard choice |
| Lyre | Excellent | 5–6 tons/acre | Recommended for high vigor |
| Bilateral cordon | Good | 3–4 tons/acre | Easy management |
| Multiple trunk | Recommended | — | Cold climate insurance |

### Crop Load Targets

| Production Level | Tons/Acre | Lbs/Vine |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| Commercial (VSP) | 3–4 | 12–16 |
| Commercial (Lyre) | 5–6 | 20–24 |
| Premium | 2–3 | 8–12 |
| Small-scale | — | 10–15 |
| Balance ratio | 5 lbs fruit : 1 lb pruning weight | — |

### Canopy Management Calendar (Pyrazine Reduction Critical)

| Timing | Task | Priority |
|--------|------|----------|
| Early growth | Shoot thinning | High |
| Shortly after fruit set | First leaf removal | CRITICAL |
| 30 days after fruit set | Second leaf removal | High |
| 50 days after fruit set | Third leaf removal | Medium |
| Throughout season | Multiple hedging passes | High |

**Pyrazine note:** IBMP (responsible for bell pepper character) detection threshold is 10–15 parts per trillion — extremely potent. Early and consistent leaf removal reduces accumulation.

### Cold Climate Strategies

1. **Multiple trunk training** — Insurance against winter kill
2. **Hill soil over graft unions** before winter
3. **Delayed pruning** — Assess bud damage before cutting
4. **Site selection** — Mid-slope, good air drainage

## Rootstock Pairings

| Rootstock | Best Use Case | Vigor Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 3309C | Cold climates (most popular NE) | Low–Moderate |
| 101-14 Mgt | Cold climates, high vigor soils | Low–Moderate |
| Riparia Gloire | Crown gall resistance, cold | Low |
| 110R | Drought tolerance | Moderate |
| 140Ru | Drought tolerance | High |

**Avoid on high vigor soils:** SO4, 3309C (already vigorous variety)

## Blending Compatibility

### Role in Blends

Cabernet Franc contributes intense floral aromatics (violets), silky refined texture, freshness, and pencil shavings complexity. Adds finesse rather than power.

### Classic Combinations

| Blend Style | Cab Franc % | Partners | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Left Bank Bordeaux | 0–10% | Cab Sauv, Merlot | "Third violin" — aromatics |
| Right Bank Bordeaux | 10–40% | Merlot dominant | Backbone, significant role |
| Château Cheval Blanc | 40–56% | Merlot | Co-dominant |
| Château Ausone | 55–65% | Merlot | Dominant |
| Loire single varietal | 100% | — | Chinon, Bourgueil, Saumur-Champigny |

### What It Contributes

- Violet and floral aromatics
- Refined, silky texture
- Freshness and lift
- Pencil shavings/graphite complexity
- Earlier accessibility than Cab Sauv

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate Zone | Fruit Character | Structure | Herbaceous Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Cool (Loire-style) | Raspberry, red currant, violets | Light–medium body, higher acidity | Bell pepper desirable when balanced |
| Moderate | Red/black cherry, tobacco, cedar | Medium+ body, moderate tannins | Subtle pencil shavings |
| Warm | Black cherry, dried fruit, spice | Fuller body | May lose distinctive character |

### Signature Aromatics

- **Primary:** Raspberry, red currant, strawberry (cool); black cherry (warm)
- **Secondary:** Violets (signature), green bell pepper, pencil shavings
- **Tertiary (aged):** Tobacco, leather, graphite, dried herbs

### Pyrazine Discussion

**When herbaceous is desirable:**
- Traditional Loire style
- Adds complexity and typicity
- Balanced with fruit character

**When it's a flaw:**
- Excessive, dominates fruit
- Associated with underripe fruit
- Result of shaded canopies
- Green and aggressive

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Climate | Brix | pH | TA (g/L) |
|---------|------|-----|---------|
| Cool climate | 21–22° | 3.1–3.3 | 7–9 |
| Moderate/warm | 23–25.5° | 3.2–3.4 | 6.5–8.0 |

### Fermentation Parameters

| Stage | Parameter | Range |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Cold soak (optional) | Duration | 2–4 days at 50°F |
| Primary fermentation | Temperature | 75–82°F (24–28°C) |
| Skin contact (light style) | Duration | 7–10 days |
| Skin contact (full extraction) | Duration | 14–21 days |

### Oak Treatment

| Level | New Oak % | Toast | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Loire style | 0–20% | Light | 6–10 months |
| Premium | 20–40% | Light–Medium | 10–14 months |
| Full extraction | 30–50% | Medium | 12–18 months |

**Important:** LIGHTER OAK preserves varietal character. Heavy oak obscures the distinctive aromatics.

### Pyrazine Management in Winery

- Inactivated dry yeast (Noblesse) can bind pyrazines
- Untoasted oak chips (2–4 g/L) can mask vegetal character
- Blending with riper lots

### MLF Recommendation

**Recommended** — Standard practice; softens acidity.

### Aging Potential

| Wine Level | Drink Window |
|------------|--------------|
| Light Loire style | 2–5 years |
| Premium | 10–20+ years |
| Top Bordeaux Right Bank | 15–30+ years |

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Advantages for Home Growers

- **Most cold-hardy vinifera red** — expands growing range
- Ripens earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon
- Botrytis resistant — less rot worry
- Produces distinctive, aromatic wines
- Works as single varietal or blend component

### Challenges for Home Growers

- Very vigorous — significant canopy work required
- Powdery mildew pressure is high
- Crown gall risk after winter damage
- Managing herbaceous character requires attention
- Virus-free plant material can be hard to source

### Practical Tips

1. **Source certified virus-free vines** — 30% of stock has leafroll
2. **Plan for multiple trunk training** in cold climates
3. **Prioritize leaf removal** — start early, do multiple passes
4. **Don't over-oak** — preserve the delicate aromatics
5. **Embrace the character** — some herbaceous notes are traditional

### Yield Expectations (Mature Vines)

- **Realistic small-scale:** 10–15 lbs/vine
- **Wine yield:** ~1 gallon per 15–18 lbs fruit
- **10-vine planting:** 6–10 gallons finished wine

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cold Hardiness:** MOST cold-hardy vinifera red — key advantage in marginal climates
2. **Vigor:** Very high — plan for aggressive canopy management
3. **Disease:** Watch powdery mildew; botrytis resistant (advantage over Merlot)
4. **Pyrazines:** Manage through leaf removal; some herbaceous character is varietal
5. **Oak:** Use restraint — heavy oak masks distinctive aromatics
6. **Wine Style:** Elegant and aromatic rather than powerful; Loire-style vs. Bordeaux-style options
