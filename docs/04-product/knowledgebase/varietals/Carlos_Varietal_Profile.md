## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Bronze, Vitis rotundifolia (Muscadine) |
| **Origin** | North Carolina breeding program |
| **Flower Type** | Perfect (self-fertile) |
| **Vigor** | Very High |
| **Ripening** | Mid-season |
| **Cold Hardiness** | Among hardiest muscadines (Zone 7+) |

## Species Context: Vitis rotundifolia

Carlos belongs to *Vitis rotundifolia*, the muscadine grape—a fundamentally different species from both European vinifera and American labrusca:

| Characteristic | Muscadine (Carlos) | Bunch Grapes (Vinifera/Labrusca) |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Chromosome count | 40 | 38 |
| Cluster type | Loose, 4–15 individual berries | Tight bunches, 50–200+ berries |
| Berry size | Large (up to 1.5 inches) | Small to medium |
| Skin thickness | Very thick | Thin to moderate |
| Native range | Southeastern US | Europe / Eastern North America |
| Cold tolerance | Damaged at 10°F; killed at 0°F | Varies widely |
| Pierce's disease | IMMUNE | Susceptible to tolerant |

**Critical advantage:** Muscadines are the only viable grape type in much of the Deep South and Florida due to complete immunity to Pierce's disease.

## Climate Requirements

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| USDA Zones | 7–9 | Experimental in Zone 6 |
| Minimum winter temp | 0°F to 10°F (-18 to -12°C) | More cold-tolerant than most muscadines |
| Growing season | 100–120 days | Late bud break to harvest |
| Ideal conditions | Warm, humid | Thrives in southeastern climate |
| Soil pH | 5.5–7.0 | Slightly acidic to neutral |
| Chill hours | Low requirement | Fewer than bunch grapes |

### Cold Hardiness Note

Carlos is among the most cold-tolerant muscadine cultivars. However, it is prone to early bud break, making it susceptible to late spring frosts even when the vine itself survives winter.

### Regional Performance

| Region | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| North Carolina | Excellent | Industry standard; 90%+ of acreage |
| Georgia | Excellent | Major production region |
| Florida | Excellent | Only viable grape type |
| Gulf Coast states | Excellent | Ideal climate match |
| South Carolina | Excellent | Strong muscadine tradition |
| Virginia (southern) | Moderate | Northern edge of range |
| Texas (eastern) | Good | Where humidity sufficient |
| Zone 6 and north | Experimental | Cold damage likely |

## Phenology

| Stage | Timing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Bud break | Late spring | Prone to early bud break |
| Flowering | Late spring/early summer | Perfect flowers—self-fertile |
| Ripening | 100–120 days from bud break | Mid-season for muscadines |
| Harvest | Late summer to early fall | Uniform ripening |

---

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Pierce's disease | IMMUNE | Complete resistance |
| Downy mildew | LOW–MODERATE | Much more tolerant than vinifera |
| Powdery mildew | LOW | Generally resistant |
| Black rot | LOW–MODERATE | Some susceptibility |
| Bitter rot | LOW–MODERATE | Monitor in wet conditions |
| Phylloxera | VERY LOW | Strong natural resistance |
| Nematodes | LOW | Tolerant |

**Key advantage:** Pierce's disease immunity makes Carlos viable where no other grape can grow successfully.

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor Characteristics

- **Rating:** Very High
- **Growth pattern:** Sprawling, vigorous vines
- **Productivity:** High yields (~45 kg/vine possible; 8–10 tons/acre)
- **Ripening:** Uniform—facilitates mechanical harvest

### Spacing Guidelines

| Configuration | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Minimum vine spacing | 10 ft (3 m) |
| Recommended spacing | 20 ft (6 m) |
| Trellis height | 5–6 ft (1.5–1.8 m) |

**Critical difference from bunch grapes:** Muscadines require *much* wider spacing—20 feet is recommended. Their vigorous growth and sprawling habit demand substantial room.

### Training System Compatibility

| System | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Single overhead wire | Excellent | Traditional, simplest system |
| Two-wire vertical | Good | Better air circulation |
| Geneva Double Curtain | Good | Adapted for muscadines |
| Arbors/pergolas | Poor | Difficult to maintain and prune |

### Cordon Development

Standard training produces:
- Two cordons extending 10 ft in opposite directions from trunk
- Total vine spread: 20 ft
- Spur spacing: 4–6 inches along cordons

### Pruning Requirements

**Timing:** Late winter (February–March) before bud break

**Method:**
- Cut back all shoot growth to 2–3 bud spurs
- Remove weak or crowded spurs
- Maintain spur spacing along cordon

**Critical:** Unpruned muscadines will not fruit properly. Heavy annual pruning is essential—it triggers the fruiting response and maintains manageable vine size.

## Flavor Profile

### Fresh Fruit

- Medium-sized bronze berries
- Very thick skin (consumer deterrent for fresh market)
- Sweet flesh with mild musky flavor
- Less intensely flavored than darker muscadines
- 4–15 berries per loose cluster

### Wine Characteristics

- Light, clean muscadine character
- Less musky than typical muscadine
- Good base for white wines
- Mild, approachable flavor profile

## Primary Uses

| Use | Quality | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Wine production | Excellent | Industry standard for white muscadine wine |
| Juice production | Excellent | Major commercial use |
| Fresh market | Fair–Poor | Small size, thick skin, wet stem scar |
| Jams/jellies | Good | Traditional southern use |

### Commercial Advantages

- Uniform ripening allows mechanical harvest
- High yields reduce production costs
- Self-fertile—no pollinator required
- Disease resistance reduces spray costs

### Fresh Market Limitations

- Small berry size compared to fresh-market cultivars
- Thick, somewhat bitter skin
- Wet stem scar reduces shelf life
- Browning tendency after refrigeration

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry

| Parameter | Typical Value | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Brix | 16–20° | Variable |
| pH | 3.2–3.6 | — |
| TA | Moderate | — |

### Wine Styles

- Dry to semi-sweet white wines
- Blending base for muscadine wines
- Sparkling muscadine (limited production)

### Processing Notes

- Thick skins require longer pressing time
- Less musky than many muscadines—cleaner wine profile
- Uniform ripening simplifies harvest timing
- Can be processed mechanically at commercial scale

---

## Pollination

**Flower type:** Perfect (self-fertile)

Carlos contains both male and female flower parts:
- Can produce fruit with its own pollen
- Can pollinate female (pistillate) cultivars nearby
- Single-vine plantings will produce fruit

**Pollinator role:** Carlos is commonly used to pollinate female muscadine cultivars like Scuppernong, Fry, and Supreme.

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Why Grow Carlos

- Industry-standard muscadine for wine/juice
- Self-fertile—single vine produces fruit
- Among the most cold-tolerant muscadines
- Excellent disease resistance
- High, reliable yields
- Uniform ripening simplifies harvest

### Challenges

- Requires warm, humid climate (Zone 7+)
- Very wide spacing needed (10–20 ft)
- Heavy annual pruning essential
- Early bud break creates frost risk
- Limited fresh-eating appeal (thick skin)

### Equipment Needs

- Strong trellis system (single or double wire)
- Heavy-duty pruning equipment
- Adequate space (10–20 ft per vine)

### Timeline Expectations

| Year | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Year 1–2 | Vine establishment, trunk development |
| Year 3 | Light first crop possible |
| Year 4–5 | Increasing production |
| Year 5+ | Full production (20–45 kg/vine possible) |

### Practical Tips

1. **Space generously**—20 ft between vines is not excessive
2. **Prune heavily**—don't skip this; muscadines require it
3. **Avoid overhead arbors**—impossible to maintain properly
4. **Watch for late frost**—early bud break is vulnerable
5. **Plan wine/juice use**—fresh-eating quality limited
