## Rootstock Pairings

| Rootstock | Best Use Case | Vigor Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 420A | High vigor soils | Low–Moderate |
| 101-14 Mgt | High vigor soils, wet tolerance | Low–Moderate |
| Schwarzmann | High vigor soils | Low |
| 110R | Drought tolerance | Moderate |
| 140Ru | Drought tolerance | High |
| 1103P | Deep soils, drought | High |
| SO4 | General purpose | Moderate–High |
| 3309C | Cool climates, low vigor needed | Low–Moderate |

**Caution:** Avoid V. berlandieri × V. rupestris parentage (1103P, 140R) which can exacerbate erratic budbreak.

## Blending Compatibility

### Role in Blends

Cabernet Sauvignon provides firm structural backbone, age-worthy tannins, deep stable pigments, and blackcurrant/cassis character with 20–50+ year longevity potential.

### Classic Combinations

| Blend Style | Cab Sauv % | Partners | Notes |
|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| Left Bank Bordeaux | 60–80% | Merlot 15–30%, Cab Franc 5–15% | Classic structure |
| Right Bank Bordeaux | 0–30% | Merlot dominant | Supporting role |
| Meritage | 40–75% | Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec | California style |
| Single varietal | 100% | — | Proven quality potential |

### What It Contributes

- Tannin structure and grip
- Deep, stable color
- Blackcurrant/cassis fruit character
- Aging potential (decades)
- Blending backbone

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate Zone | Fruit Character | Structure | Alcohol | Risks |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Cool (Bordeaux, coastal) | Blackcurrant, green bell pepper, mint, graphite | HIGH acidity, SHARP tannins | 12–13.5% | Herbaceous/underripe |
| Moderate (Napa, Paso) | Black cherry, blackberry, cassis, cedar | Balanced acidity, FIRM approachable tannins | 13.5–14.5% | — |
| Warm (Central Valley, inland) | Jammy blackberry, prune notes | LOW acidity, SOFT/PLUSH tannins | 14.5–16%+ | "Cooked" character |

### Signature Aromatics

- **Primary:** Blackcurrant (cassis), black cherry, blackberry
- **Secondary:** Cedar, tobacco, graphite, eucalyptus/mint (cool climate)
- **Tertiary (aged):** Leather, cigar box, earth, dried herbs

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Parameter | Target Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Brix | 24–26.5° | Higher end for full phenolic ripeness |
| pH | 3.3–3.5 | Watch for climbing pH in warm climates |
| TA | 6.0–7.0 g/L | Adjust post-fermentation if needed |

### Fermentation Parameters

| Stage | Parameter | Range |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Cold soak | Temperature | 50–55°F (10–13°C) |
| Cold soak | Duration | 3–7 days |
| Primary fermentation | Temperature | 75–85°F (24–29°C) |
| Skin contact | Total duration | 14–30 days |
| Press timing | After dryness | When cap falls, tannins soften |

### Oak Treatment

| Level | New Oak % | Toast | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Entry | 0–20% | Light–Medium | 6–12 months |
| Premium | 50–80% | Medium | 12–18 months |
| Ultra-premium | 80–100% | Medium–Heavy | 18–24 months |

### MLF Recommendation

**Recommended** — Softens malic acid, integrates tannins, adds complexity.

### Aging Potential

| Wine Level | Drink Window |
|------------|--------------|
| Entry/commercial | 1–5 years |
| Premium | 10–25 years |
| First growth/iconic | 20–50+ years |

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Advantages for Home Growers

- Late bud break avoids many spring frosts
- Thick skins resist splitting and botrytis
- Excellent aging rewards patient winemakers
- Well-documented management practices

### Challenges for Home Growers

- Requires long, warm growing season
- High vigor demands significant canopy work
- Harsh tannins when young — needs cellar time
- Late harvest competes with fall weather

### Practical Tips

1. **Site selection:** Full sun, south-facing slope, well-drained soil
2. **Don't rush harvest:** Wait for seed browning and flavor development
3. **Manage canopy aggressively:** Plan for 4–6 hedging passes
4. **Plan for aging:** Build cellar capacity — these wines reward patience
5. **Consider blending:** Even 15–20% Merlot softens young wine significantly

### Yield Expectations (Mature Vines)

- **Realistic small-scale:** 8–15 lbs/vine
- **Wine yield:** ~1 gallon per 15–18 lbs fruit
- **10-vine planting:** 5–10 gallons finished wine

## Regional Suitability (US)

| Region | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Napa Valley, CA | Excellent | Benchmark region |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Climate:** Needs 2,500+ GDD; late budding but very late ripening
2. **Management:** High vigor requires aggressive canopy control
3. **Disease:** Watch powdery mildew closely; botrytis rarely an issue
4. **Harvest:** Wait for phenolic ripeness — seeds tell the story
5. **Wine:** Age-worthy backbone; patience required for best results
6. **Blending:** Classic backbone variety; complements Merlot and Cab Franc
