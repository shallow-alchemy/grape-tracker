| Winkler Region | III-IV | Moderate to warm |
| Heat Requirement | Moderate-High | — |
| Drought Tolerance | Moderate-Good | — |

### Critical Temperature Thresholds

| Threshold | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------|
| Photosynthesis Shutdown | >35°C (95°F) |
| Dormant LT50 | -15 to -21°C |
| Bud Frost Damage | <0°C (32°F) |

---

## Phenology

**Budbreak Order:** Mid-season. Requires 75-87 GDD to budbreak.

### Harvest Timing

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Typical Harvest | Early-mid September |
| Days Bloom→Harvest | 100-115 |
| Target Brix | 24-26° |
| Target pH | 3.5-3.7 |

### Phenological GDD Thresholds (base 10°C)

| Stage | GDD |
|-------|-----|
| Budbreak | 75-87 |

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery Mildew | Moderate-High | — |
| Downy Mildew | Moderate | — |
| Botrytis | Moderate-High | Tight clusters contribute |
| Eutypa | Susceptible | — |
| Special Concerns | — | Shiraz disease (viral); reduction tendency |

### Disease Management Summary

- **Spray Intensity:** Moderate
- **Primary Concern:** Powdery/downy mildew
- **Secondary Concern:** Botrytis (tight clusters)

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor and Training

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Vigor | **High** |
| Preferred Training | VSP, cordon |
| Growth Habit | Horizontal (requires trellising) |
| Crop Load (tons/acre) | 2-4 (premium: 2-3) |

**Critical Note:** Syrah is the only Rhône variety with a horizontal growth habit, which means it requires trellising. It is the only variety permitted to be trellised in gobelet-required Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

### Canopy Management

| Task | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Shoot Thinning | Required (3×) |
| Leaf Removal | Essential |
| Cluster Thinning | Often required |
| Overall Intensity | **High** |

### Rootstock Recommendations

| Category | Rootstocks |
|----------|------------|
| Primary | Schwarzmann, 420A |
| Alternative | 101-14, SO4 |
| Drought-Tolerant | 110R, 1103P |
| Avoid | Salt Creek (copper toxicity issues) |

## Winemaking Profile

### Oxidation/Reduction Tendency

- **Tendency:** Moderately reductive
- **Management:** Open-top fermenters; monitor H₂S

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Brix | 24-26° |
| pH | 3.5-3.7 |
| TA (g/L) | 5.5-6.0 |

**Special Note:** Monitor berry shriveling above 21-22°Brix.

### Fermentation Parameters

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Temperature | 75-85°F (24-30°C) |
| Skin Contact | 7-21 days |
| Whole Cluster | Up to 60% (cool); 20-30% (warm) |
| Oak Preference | French or American; 25-35% new |

### Aging Potential

| Level | Window |
|-------|--------|
| Standard | 5-10 years |
| Premium | 15-20+ years |

Gains leather, truffle with age.

## Blending Role

### GSM Contribution

- **Primary Contribution:** Color, structure, tannin
- **Sensory Impact:** Dark fruits, pepper, longevity

### Viognier Co-fermentation (Côte-Rôtie Tradition)

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Legal Maximum | 20% Viognier |
| Typical Practice | 5-10% |
| Requirement | Must be co-fermented (not blended post-fermentation) |
| Effect at 5% | No perceivable color difference |
| Effect at 10-20% | Aromatic lift; potential color dilution |

**Technique:** Destem and crush Viognier on top of destemmed Syrah before fermentation. Viognier flavanols conjugate with Syrah anthocyanins, shifting color toward purple/blue.

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Cool | White pepper (rotundone), blackcurrant, olive, nervy acidity |
| Moderate | Blackberry, plum, black pepper, smoke |
| Warm/Hot | Jammy blueberry, chocolate, tar; 14-15.5% ABV |

### Rotundone Note

Syrah's signature peppery character comes from rotundone, a sesquiterpene that develops in cool climates with late harvest, high vigor, and ample water. Australian research confirms cool-climate Shiraz shows highest rotundone concentrations.

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Advantages

- Widely adapted across climates
- Excellent single-varietal and blending potential
- Strong market recognition

### Challenges

- High vigor requires intensive canopy management
- Horizontal growth habit complicates training
- Three-pass shoot thinning typical
- Reductive tendency requires cellar attention

### Beginner Accessibility

**Rating:** Moderate

Syrah is manageable for experienced growers but demands consistent canopy work and attention to reduction during winemaking.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Vigor:** HIGH — requires trellising and intensive canopy management
2. **Growth Habit:** Unique horizontal growth among Rhône varieties
3. **Climate Range:** Regions III-IV; expresses differently by climate
4. **Signature:** Peppery rotundone in cool climates
5. **Winemaking:** Monitor reduction; whole cluster adds complexity
6. **Blending:** Provides color/structure to GSM; co-ferments with Viognier
