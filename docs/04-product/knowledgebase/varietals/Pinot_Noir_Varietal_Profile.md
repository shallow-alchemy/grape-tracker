## Climate Requirements

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Minimum GDD | ~2,000°F (Region I) | Marginal — may not ripen fully |
| Optimal GDD | 2,200–2,800°F (Region I–II) | Best quality range |
| Maximum GDD | 3,000°F | Above this, loses varietal character |
| Dormant bud LT50 | -4°F to -8°F (-20 to -22°C) | When fully hardened |
| Green swollen buds | 26°F (-3.3°C) | Damage threshold |
| Bud burst damage | 28°F (-2.2°C) | Critical |
| Two-leaf stage | 29°F (-1.7°C) | Damage threshold |
| Heat shutdown | ~95°F (35°C) | Photosynthesis slows significantly |
| Photosynthesis optimum | 77–86°F (25–30°C) | Ideal range |
| Chill hours required | 800–1,200 hours (<45°F) | Moderate–high requirement |

### Cold Hardiness Context

Classification: "Tender" category (0 to -8°F for 50% primary bud kill)

**Hardiness ranking:** More cold-hardy than Merlot, less than Cabernet Franc or Riesling

Secondary buds survive colder than primaries; tertiary buds most tolerant.

## Phenology

| Stage | GDD (base 50°F) | Relative Timing |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Bud break | ~103 GDD | Early — frost risk |
| Flowering | ~601 GDD | Early–mid season |
| Veraison | ~1,825 GDD | 50–60 days after bloom |
| Harvest | ~2,252 GDD | 100–120 days from bloom |
| Total season | 150–190 days | — |

**Harvest order:** Among the earliest red vinifera to ripen

### Ripeness Indicators

| Parameter | Target Range | Optimal |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Brix | 21–26° | 24–25° |
| pH | 3.2–3.6 | 3.35–3.45 |
| TA | 4.9–8.6 g/L | 7.0 g/L |
| Seeds | Brown (green = bitter) | Fully brown, chewable |

**Lag phase:** ~55 days post-bloom when berries reach 50% final weight. Seed hardness is primary indicator.

---

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery mildew | HIGH | 8–10 fungicide applications/season required |
| Downy mildew | HIGH | Major concern in humid climates |
| Botrytis | VERY HIGH | Thin skins + tight clusters trap moisture |
| Sour rot | HIGH | Linked to compact cluster architecture |
| Eutypa | Moderate | Trunk disease concern for mature vines |
| Phylloxera | VERY HIGH | Grafting mandatory |

### Structural Vulnerabilities

Pinot Noir's defining characteristics create ideal conditions for fungal infection:
- **Thin skins** — easily damaged, poor barrier
- **Compact "pine cone" clusters** — trap moisture
- **Small berries** — high skin-to-juice ratio

No inherent resistance to powdery mildew, downy mildew, or phylloxera.

### Critical Spray Timing

- Begin: 2 weeks pre-bloom
- Continue: Through 4 weeks post-capfall
- Berry resistance: Effectively ends at 8% Brix
- Sporulation continues to 15% Brix

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor Characteristics

- **Rating:** Moderate to Moderately High
- **Growth pattern:** Prone to excessive vegetative growth in fertile soils
- **Canopy density:** Can become dense without management
- **Shoot growth:** Requires consistent hedging

### Spacing Guidelines

| Configuration | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Row spacing | 7–8 ft (2.1–2.4 m) |
| Vine spacing | 4–5 ft (1.2–1.5 m) |
| Vines/acre (standard) | 1,089–1,362 |
| Vines/acre (high-density) | Up to 2,000+ |
| Oregon standard | 4' × 8' = 1,362 vines/acre |

### Training System Compatibility

| System | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| VSP | Excellent | Primary choice worldwide |
| Guyot (cane pruning) | Excellent | Traditional Burgundy, Oregon |
| Bilateral cordon | Good | Easier management |
| High-density | Good | Increases labor significantly |

**Pruning:** Cane pruning traditional; 15–20 buds/vine typical.

### Crop Load Targets

| Production Level | Tons/Acre | Lbs/Vine |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| Premium | 2.0–3.0 | 4–6 |
| Standard | 3.5–4.0 | 7–8 |
| Clusters/vine | 20–30 | Clone dependent |
| Linear guideline | 1 lb fruit/linear foot of row | — |

### Canopy Management Calendar

| Timing | Task | Priority |
|--------|------|----------|
| 2–4" shoots | Shoot thinning | High |
| Pre-bloom | First leaf removal (fruit zone) | High |
| Bloom | Disease scouting intensifies | Critical |
| Post-fruit set | Cluster thinning if needed | Medium |
| Throughout season | Shoot positioning (58+ hrs/acre) | High |
| Throughout season | Hedging (2+ passes, 40+ hrs/acre) | High |

### Labor Requirements (Per Acre, Full Production)

| Task | Hours |
|------|-------|
| Shoot positioning | 58+ |
| Hedging (2 passes) | 40+ |
| Disbudding/sucker removal | 27 |
| **Total canopy work** | **150+** |

## Clone Selection

Clone selection profoundly affects Pinot Noir wine character. This variety has more clonal variation than almost any other.

| Clone | Characteristics | Best Use |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Pommard (UCD 4/5) | Meaty, gamey, dark fruit, structured, high tannin, "cola" signature | Stand-alone foundation wine |
| Wädenswil (2A) | Cool-climate adapted, natural disease resistance, spicy | Oregon heritage, blending |
| Dijon 115 | Most planted; balanced, complete, dark cherry, rose, leather | Backbone/"spine" for blends |
| Dijon 667 | Red fruit energy, cranberry, fine tannins, Christmas spice | Blend structure, earlier ripening |
| Dijon 777 | Dark, rich, intense color, pronounced tannins, cassis, spicy | Aging potential, stand-alone |
| Dijon 114 | Early ripening, complex, perfumed | Cool sites |
| 828 ("Suitcase") | Dense, structured, boysenberry, blackberry, high tannin | Adds depth/structure |
| Calera | Brown spice (cinnamon, clove), cranberry | Character addition |
| Mt. Eden (37) | Small clusters, intense flavor, velvety tannins, deep color | Complexity |

**Disease note:** Dijon 777 produces looser clusters than 115 or 667, reducing botrytis pressure.

## Rootstock Pairings

| Rootstock | Vigor | Best Conditions | Cold Tolerance |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 3309C | Low–Moderate | Deep moist soils | Good |
| 101-14 Mgt | Moderate | Moist soils | Moderate |
| Riparia Gloire | Very Low | High-vigor sites | Excellent |
| Schwarzmann | Low–Moderate | Moderate sites | Moderate |
| 420A | Low | High-vigor, high-K exclusion | Fair |
| 110R | Moderate–High | Drought | Fair |
| 1103P | Moderate–High | Drought, varied soils | Fair |
| SO4 | Moderate–High | Various; advances veraison | Fair |

**Critical notes:**
- **Avoid Rupestris du Lot** — causes coulure in small-clustered varieties
- **Avoid 3309C where nematodes present**
- 3309C is most common rootstock in Oregon — promotes early ripening
- Match low-vigor rootstocks with fertile, high-water sites

## Blending Compatibility

### Traditional Use

Burgundy law requires **100% Pinot Noir** for red wines. Oregon mandates **90%+** for varietal labeling. Single-varietal expression is the global standard.

### Sparkling Wine Role

In Champagne, Pinot Noir contributes:
- Body and structure
- Richness and weight
- Red fruit character
- Typically 30–50% of cuvées

**Blanc de Noirs:** 100% Pinot Noir (and/or Pinot Meunier)

**Sparkling harvest:** Earlier at 20–21°Brix to preserve acidity.

### What It Contributes (When Blended)

- Red fruit character
- Silky texture
- Aromatic complexity
- Structure without heaviness

---

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate Zone | Fruit Character | Structure | Signature Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cool (Burgundy, Oregon, NZ) | Red cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry | High acidity, lighter body, silky tannins | Rose petals, mushroom, forest floor, mineral |
| Moderate (coastal CA, parts of Australia) | Red and black cherry, raspberry | Medium body, balanced acidity | Subtle spice, herbs, light earth |
| Warm (inland CA, warmer sites) | Black cherry, plum, blackberry | Fuller body, lower acidity, softer tannins | Vanilla, cola, chocolate (oak influence) |

### Signature Aromatics

- **Primary:** Cherry (red to black by climate), raspberry, strawberry
- **Secondary:** Rose petals, violet, tea, forest floor
- **Tertiary (aged):** Mushroom, truffle, leather, game, dried herbs

### Oregon Signature

Distinctive "cherry-cola" note in Willamette Valley expressions.

### Climate Risks

- **Too cool:** Unripe green notes, thin body
- **Too warm:** Flat, flabby, loses elegance, "jammy"

Thin skins produce low tannin regardless of climate — extraction technique matters more than temperature.

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Parameter | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Brix | 24–25° | Higher = higher alcohol |
| pH | 3.35–3.45 | Critical for stability |
| TA | 6.5–8.0 g/L | — |
| YAN | 150–300 ppm | Supplement if <150 |

### Fermentation Parameters

| Stage | Parameter | Range |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Cold soak | Temperature | 40–50°F (5–10°C) |
| Cold soak | Duration | 3–10 days |
| Primary fermentation | Temperature | 75–90°F (24–32°C) |
| Peak extraction | Temperature | ~85°F |
| Total maceration | Duration | 10–25 days |
| Press timing | Brix | At or near 0 (never >5) |
| Cap management | Frequency | 3+ times daily (punch down) |

### Whole Cluster Fermentation

Including stems adds spice, structure, and stem tannin.

| Usage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0% | Fruit-forward, softer |
| 10–40% | Measurable spice/structure |
| 50–100% | Traditional Burgundy, significant tannin |

**Critical:** Stems must be fully lignified (brown). Green stems create harsh, bitter tannins.

### Oak Treatment

| Level | New Oak % | Duration |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Light | 0–20% | 10–14 months |
| Standard | 20–35% | 12–16 months |
| Premium | 35–50% | 14–18 months |

**French oak preferred** for subtlety. Over-oaking easily masks Pinot Noir's delicate character — restraint essential.

### MLF Recommendation

**Nearly universal** for red Pinot Noir. Increases pH by 0.15–0.30 units. Post-MLF pH typically 3.45–3.65.

### Aging Potential

| Wine Level | Drink Window |
|------------|--------------|
| Entry/village | 2–5 years |
| Premier Cru | 5–15 years |
| Grand Cru | 10–30+ years |

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Why "Difficult"?

Pinot Noir's reputation as the "heartbreak grape" stems from multiple factors:

1. **Climate sensitivity:** Narrow optimal window
2. **Disease pressure:** Minimum 8–10 spray applications/season
3. **Thin skins:** Susceptible to rot, damage, birds, insects
4. **Tight clusters:** Trap moisture, promote infection
5. **Mutation tendency:** High clonal variability
6. **Transparency:** Flaws show clearly — hides nothing
7. **Site specificity:** Expresses terroir extremely well, including poor terroir

### Home Vineyard Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Spray program | Mandatory — ~$400/acre/year fungicide cost |
| Bird netting | Essential |
| Disease scouting | Weekly minimum |
| Year 1 labor | 100+ hours establishment |
| Full production | Not reached until year 5 |
| Vine lifespan | 25–35 years |

### Equipment Needs

- Air-blast sprayer
- Mower
- Hedger
- Leaf puller

### Yield Expectations (Mature Vines)

- **Realistic small-scale:** 4–6 lbs/vine
- **Wine yield:** ~1 gallon per 15–18 lbs fruit
- **10-vine planting:** 2–4 gallons finished wine

### Practical Tips

1. **Clone selection matters enormously** — research before ordering
2. **Site for air drainage** — reduce disease pressure
3. **Don't skip sprays** — the variety cannot succeed without protection
4. **Handle fruit gently** — thin skins damage easily
5. **Start small** — 20–50 vines to learn before scaling
