## Phenology

| Stage | GDD (base 50°F) | Relative Timing |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Bud break | ~135 GDD | VERY EARLY — first vinifera |
| Flowering | ~620 GDD | 10–14 day duration |
| Veraison | ~1,922 GDD | 60–70 days post-bloom |
| Harvest | ~2,281 GDD | 100–120 days from bloom |

**Bud break timing:** 7–10 days before Cabernet Sauvignon

### Ripeness Indicators

| Parameter | Sparkling | Table Wine | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Brix | 18–20° | 22–25° | >25° risks flat wine |
| pH | 2.9–3.1 | 3.0–3.3 | Rises during fermentation |
| TA | 8–10 g/L | 6–9 g/L | Target 6.0 g/L finished |
| Seeds | — | Brown = mature | Green = bitter |

### Regional Harvest Timing

| Region | Typical Harvest |
|--------|-----------------|
| Champagne | September–October |
| Burgundy | September |
| California | August–September |
| Oregon | September |

**Millerandage note:** Cool bloom temperatures can cause irregular fruit set with many small, seedless berries.

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor Characteristics

- **Rating:** Moderate to Vigorous
- **Tendency:** Prone to overcropping
- **Pruning weight guideline:** >0.4 lb cane prunings/foot of canopy = excessively vigorous
- **Canopy density:** Requires management for disease control

### Spacing Guidelines

| Site Condition | Row Spacing | Vine Spacing |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Standard | 7–11 ft | 6–8 ft |
| Low-vigor rootstocks | — | 3–4 ft |
| High-vigor expected | — | 8–12 ft |
| Commercial example | 7' × 11' | 566 vines/acre |

### Training System Compatibility

| System | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| VSP | Excellent | Primary choice; improves disease management |
| Bilateral cordon | Good | Ease of management |
| Open Lyre | Good | High-vigor sites |
| Smart-Dyson | Good | Divided canopy option |
| Geneva Double Curtain | Good | High-vigor sites |

### Crop Load Targets

| Production Level | Tons/Acre | Lbs/Vine |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| Premium | 3.0–4.0 | 12–18 |
| Standard | 4.0–6.75 | 18–30 |
| Sparkling base | 4–6 | — |

### Canopy Management Calendar

| Timing | Task | Priority |
|--------|------|----------|
| 2–4" shoots | Shoot thinning | High |
| Pre-bloom | Leaf removal (4–6 basal leaves) | Critical |
| Bloom | Disease scouting | High |
| Post-fruit set | Cluster thinning if needed | Medium |
| Throughout season | Hedging | Medium |

**Leaf removal benefit:** Exposed fruit develops thicker cuticle, reducing mildew and botrytis susceptibility.

## Clone Selection

### Dijon Clones (French) — Lower Vigor, Earlier Ripening

| Clone | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| 76 | Small berries/clusters, good structure, acidity, perfume; medium fertility |
| 95 | Full, rich, balanced; uniform fruit set in cool bloom; very good quality |
| 96 | Pear character, tropical notes; medium-high acidity; regular production |
| 548 | Highest ripeness/quality; lowest yield; looser bunches; fastest ripening |
| 77/809 | Muscat/aromatic character; high linalool; orange blossom notes |
| 75, 78, 121, 124, 125, 277 | More vigorous, higher-yielding |

### California/Wente Selections

| Clone | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Old Wente | Field selection; small clusters, lower yield; mineral character; "hens and chicks"; late ripening |
| UCD 4 | High acid, high sugar, high yield; slower ripening; excellent for full MLF |
| Wente/Rued | 10–15% less TA than Clone 4; ideal cool climates |

### Climate Matching

| Climate | Recommended Clones |
|---------|--------------------|
| Cool | Dijon 76, 95, 96 (earlier ripening) |
| Warm | Clone 4 (acid retention) |
| Any | Multiple clones for complexity |

## Rootstock Pairings

| Rootstock | Vigor | Best Conditions | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| 3309C | Low–Moderate | Deep moist soils | Avoid where nematodes present |
| 101-14 Mgt | Moderate | Versatile | Good general choice |
| Schwarzmann | Low–Moderate | Waterlogging tolerant | — |
| 420A | Low | High density, alkaline | — |
| SO4 | Moderate–Vigorous | Wet soils | — |
| 110R | Moderate–High | Drought | Cosmetic scion overgrowth at union |
| 1103P | Moderate–High | Drought | May induce unexpectedly low vigor with Chardonnay |
| Freedom, RS-3, RS-9 | Varies | Nematode areas | Excellent nematode resistance |

**Avoid:** 140Ru — promotes coulure in small-clustered varieties.

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate Zone | Fruit Character | Structure | Signature Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Cool (Chablis, Champagne, NZ) | Green apple, lemon, lime, grapefruit | High acidity, light–medium body | Wet flint, chalk, oyster shell, mineral |
| Moderate (Burgundy Côte d'Or, Sonoma Coast) | Yellow apple, pear, stone fruits | Medium acidity and body | Hazelnut, brioche (with oak/MLF) |
| Warm (Napa, inland Australia) | Tropical (pineapple, mango, passionfruit), ripe peach | Medium-low acidity, medium-full body | Rich, round mouthfeel |

### The Oak Spectrum

| Style | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| Unoaked (stainless) | Primary fruit preserved, crisp acidity, lean/mineral |
| Lightly oaked | Rounded mouthfeel, fruit still prominent |
| Heavily oaked (new French) | Vanilla, toast, clove, baking spices, buttery/creamy |
| New American oak | More aggressive vanilla, coconut notes |

### Stylistic Range

Chardonnay has the widest stylistic range of any white variety, entirely dependent on winemaking choices rather than inherent varietal character.

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Style | Brix | pH | TA (g/L) |
|-------|------|-----|---------|
| Sparkling | 18–20° | 2.9–3.1 | 8–10 |
| Crisp table | 21–23° | 3.0–3.2 | 7–9 |
| Full-bodied | 23–25° | 3.2–3.4 | 6–8 |

### Fermentation Parameters

| Style | Temperature | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Crisp/aromatic | 50–55°F (10–13°C) | Preserves fruit esters |
| Standard white | 55–60°F (13–16°C) | Balance of fruit/complexity |
| Fuller style | 60–65°F (16–18°C) | More body development |
| Barrel fermented | 60–68°F (16–20°C) | Enhanced oak integration |

### Malolactic Fermentation (MLF)

| Approach | Effect | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Full MLF | Buttery, creamy (diacetyl); pH rises 0.1–0.3 | Rich, oaked styles |
| Partial MLF (20–50%) | Texture without losing acidity | Balanced styles |
| No MLF | Preserves crisp acidity, fruit-forward | Chablis-style, sparkling |

**Blocking MLF:** SO₂ >25ppm free, low temps (50–57°F), or sterile filtration.

**Clone note:** Full MLF works best with Clone 4 (higher acidity base).

### Oak Treatment

| Type | Character |
|------|-----------|
| New French (0–40%) | Vanilla, spice, toast |
| Used French (60–100%) | Subtle, oxidative |
| New American | Coconut, vanilla, aggressive |

| Toast Level | Character |
|-------------|-----------|
| Light | Subtle wood, minimal flavor |
| Medium | Vanilla, spice, nuts |
| Medium+ | Caramel, toast |
| Heavy | Smoke, char, espresso |

### Sur Lie Aging

| Duration | Frequency | Benefits |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 6–18 months | Weekly to monthly bâtonnage | Creamy texture, flinty aroma, autolytic character (bread, brioche) |

### Style Summary

| Chablis/Crisp | Burgundian/Rich | California/Opulent |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Stainless fermentation | Barrel fermentation | High new oak (30–50%) |
| No MLF | Full MLF | Full MLF |
| No oak or neutral | Sur lie with bâtonnage | Extended lees contact |
| Cool fermentation | 15–18 months barrel | Warmer fermentation |
| Early bottling | 20–30% new oak | Later harvest |

### Aging Potential

| Wine Level | Drink Window |
|------------|--------------|
| Unoaked/simple | 1–3 years |
| Quality oaked | 3–8 years |
| Premier Cru Burgundy | 8–15 years |
| Grand Cru Burgundy | 10–20+ years |

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### "The Winemaker's Grape"

Chardonnay's reputation as a "blank canvas" reflects its malleability — it takes on the impression of site and technique more than asserting varietal character. This creates both opportunity (stylistic range) and challenge (requires intentional decisions).

### Advantages for Home Growers

- Highly adaptable to various climates
- Wide stylistic range in winemaking
- Well-documented management practices
- Good yields
- Forgiving in the cellar

### Challenges for Home Growers

- Very early bud break = frost risk
- Disease pressure requires spray program
- Tight clusters need management
- Stylistic decisions required (oak? MLF?)

### Site Selection Critical

- **Avoid frost pockets** — early bud break is the primary vulnerability
- Good air drainage essential
- South-facing slopes in cooler areas
- Shelter from late spring frosts

### Home Vineyard Expectations

| Year | Production |
|------|------------|
| 1–2 | Training, minimal fruit |
| 3 | 2–4 lbs/vine |
| 4+ | 8–15 lbs/vine (mature) |

**Rule of thumb:** ~15–20 lbs grapes per gallon of wine

### Practical Tips

1. **Clone selection:** Dijon 76, 95, 96 for cooler areas; Clone 4 for warmer
2. **Multiple clones:** Recommended for insurance and complexity
3. **Decide style early:** Oaked vs. unoaked determines equipment needs
4. **Experiment with portions:** Split batches for oak/no oak, MLF/no MLF
5. **Start with 20–50 vines** to learn without overwhelming workload

### Yield Expectations (Mature Vines)

- **Realistic small-scale:** 8–15 lbs/vine
- **Wine yield:** ~1 gallon per 15–20 lbs fruit
- **10-vine planting:** 4–10 gallons finished wine
