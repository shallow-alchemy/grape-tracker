## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery mildew | LOW | "Little sensitive" — variety advantage |
| Downy mildew | Moderate | Standard protection needed |
| Botrytis | Low–Moderate | Thick skins, small berries, loose clusters help |
| Millerandage | HIGH | Primary variety-specific concern |
| Phylloxera | HIGH | Rootstock required |

### Millerandage (Poor Fruit Set)

The name "Petit Verdot" means "little green" — referring to berries that fail to develop. This is the variety's signature challenge.

**Causes:**
- Cool, wet, windy weather during bloom
- Temperature below 50°F (10°C) during flowering
- Poor pollination conditions

**Management:**
- Site selection for warm, sheltered bloom conditions
- Expect variable yields year to year
- Some mixed berry sizes actually contribute to wine complexity

## Blending Compatibility

### Role in Blends

Petit Verdot is the "seasoning" variety — small additions create dramatic impact. Contributes dense violet-black color, firm tannic backbone, violet/floral aromatics, acidity retention, and longevity.

### Classic Combinations

| Usage | Typical % | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Bordeaux traditional | 1–5% | Often 0% in cool years when unripe |
| California Meritage | 5–15% | Color/structure enhancement |
| Château Bolaire | Up to 40% | Bordeaux exception |
| Virginia/Australia varietal | 100% | Regional success story |

### What It Contributes

- **Color:** Deep, inky, blue-black pigmentation
- **Tannin:** Firm, age-worthy structure
- **Aromatics:** Violet, lilac, lavender (signature)
- **Acidity:** Helps retain freshness
- **Longevity:** Enhances aging potential of blends

### Blending Impact

| Addition % | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 2–3% | Noticeable color deepening |
| 5% | Color + aromatic lift |
| 10–15% | Significant structural impact |
| 100% | Full varietal expression (warm climates only) |

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate Zone | Character | Viability |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Cool | Often fails to ripen — green, vegetal, harsh tannins | NOT RECOMMENDED |
| Moderate | Blackberry, violet emerging, firm tannins | Marginal |
| Warm/Hot (optimal) | Plum, blackberry, blueberry; violet, lilac, lavender (signature); sage, leather, tobacco, graphite | IDEAL |

### Signature Aromatics

- **Young wine:** Banana, pencil shavings, dark fruit
- **Mature wine:** Violets (signature), leather, plum, graphite
- **Primary:** Blackberry, blueberry, plum
- **Floral:** Violet, lilac, lavender — highly distinctive

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Parameter | Target Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Brix | 23–26° | Virginia avg: 23.2–24.4° |
| pH | 3.4–3.75 | Watch for high K driving pH up |
| TA | 5.5–7.5 g/L | Virginia avg: 7.2 g/L |
| Potassium | 1250–1340 mg/L | HIGH K = pH management critical |

### pH Management — Critical Challenge

High potassium in Petit Verdot skins causes TA drop and pH rise during fermentation. Final wine pH often reaches ~4.0 even when harvest pH looks attractive.

**Solution:** Add 2 g/L tartaric acid at crush (Virginia research recommendation).

### Fermentation Parameters

| Stage | Parameter | Range |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Cold soak | Duration | 3–5 days |
| Cold soak | Purpose | Extract color, floral character |
| Primary fermentation | Temperature | 79–82°F (26–28°C) |
| Skin contact | Standard | 14–21 days |
| Skin contact | Extended | 25+ days beneficial |

**Extended maceration benefit:** Increases color stability and tannin polymerization.

### Oak Treatment

| Level | New Oak % | Toast | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Standard | 40–55% | Medium | 15–18 months |
| Premium | 55–80% | Medium–Heavy | 18–24 months |
| Full extraction | 70–100% | Medium | 24–30 months |

Petit Verdot can handle significant new oak due to its intense fruit and tannin.

### MLF Recommendation

**Recommended** — Standard practice; helps soften firm tannins.

### Aging Potential

| Wine Level | Drink Window |
|------------|--------------|
| Blending component | Per base wine |
| Varietal (warm climate) | 10–20+ years |
| Premium Virginia/Australia | 15–25+ years |
