## Climate Requirements

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Optimal GDD (°C-days) | 1,693 | — |
| Winkler Region | III-V | Warm to hot |
| Heat Requirement | High | — |
| Drought Tolerance | **High** | Excellent adaptation |

### Critical Temperature Thresholds

| Threshold | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------|
| Photosynthesis Shutdown | >35°C (95°F) |
| Dormant LT50 | -15 to -18°C |
| Bud Frost Damage | <0°C (32°F) |

---

## Phenology

**Budbreak Order:** Early (early April).

### Harvest Timing

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Typical Harvest | Late September |
| Days Bloom→Harvest | 100-120 |
| Target Brix | **25-27°** |
| Target pH | 3.3-3.45 |

**Critical Note:** Sugar accumulates rapidly; harvest promptly to avoid excessive alcohol.

### Critical Timing: Bloom Sensitivity

Wind and cool temperatures (<15°C) during flowering cause severe shatter (coulure). This 1-2 week period is crop-defining.

### Phenological GDD Thresholds (base 10°C)

| Stage | GDD |
|-------|-----|
| Budbreak | 50-70 |
| Flowering | 370-390 |
| Veraison | 1112-1180 |
| Maturity | 1,693 |

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery Mildew | Moderate-High | — |
| Downy Mildew | Susceptible | — |
| Botrytis | Susceptible | — |
| Eutypa | Standard | — |
| Special Concerns | — | **Oxidation-prone**; coulure/shatter |

### Disease Management Summary

- **Spray Intensity:** Moderate
- **Primary Concern:** Powdery mildew
- **Secondary Concern:** Downy mildew, botrytis

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor and Training

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Vigor | Moderate-High |
| Preferred Training | **Gobelet/bush vine** |
| Growth Habit | **Upright, self-supporting** |
| Crop Load (tons/acre) | 1-3 (bush: 1-2) |

**Key Advantage:** Grenache's upright, rigid wood makes it ideal for traditional bush training without trellis infrastructure. Bush training also protects against wind damage during bloom.

### Canopy Management

| Task | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Shoot Thinning | As needed |
| Leaf Removal | Moderate |
| Cluster Thinning | Quality-dependent |
| Overall Intensity | Moderate |

### Rootstock Recommendations

| Category | Rootstocks |
|----------|------------|
| Primary | 110R, SO4 |
| Alternative | 101-14, Malague 44-53 |
| Drought-Tolerant | **110R, 140Ru, Malague 44-53** |
| Avoid | High vigor on fertile sites |

## Winemaking Profile

### Oxidation/Reduction Tendency

- **Tendency:** **Highly oxidation-prone**
- **Management:** Minimize air exposure; careful SO₂; early bottling; top barrels frequently; use inert gas

This is a critical winemaking consideration for Grenache. The oxidation tendency makes it complementary to Mourvèdre (highly reductive) in GSM blends.

### Harvest Chemistry Targets

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Brix | 25-27° |
| pH | 3.3-3.45 |
| TA (g/L) | 6-7.5 |

**Special Note:** Sugar accumulates rapidly; harvest promptly.

### Fermentation Parameters

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Temperature | **65-75°F (18-24°C)** |
| Skin Contact | Extended (color extraction) |
| Whole Cluster | Minimal |
| Oak Preference | **Neutral/large format** |

**Critical:** Cool fermentation preserves delicate aromatics. Hot fermentation causes herbaceous, coarse character.

### Aging Potential

| Level | Window |
|-------|--------|
| Standard | 2-5 years |
| Premium (old vine) | 10-20+ years |

Old vine wines age best.

## Blending Role

### GSM Contribution

- **Primary Contribution:** Fruit, body, alcohol
- **Sensory Impact:** Red fruits, warmth, glycerin, soft tannins

### Traditional Blend Ratios

| Style | Grenache % |
|-------|------------|
| Southern Rhône standard | 40-70% |
| Châteauneuf-du-Pape | 50-80%+ |
| Côtes du Rhône (AOC) | Lead variety (GSM ≥60% of wine) |

---

## Flavor Profile by Climate

| Climate | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| Cool | Lighter body, strawberry, cherry, herbal; Pinot-like |
| Moderate | Red/dark fruits, garrigue herbs, cinnamon |
| Warm/Hot | Rich black cherry, fig; **14.5-16%+ ABV** |

**Alcohol Note:** Grenache naturally accumulates high sugar regardless of climate, making alcohol management crucial. Wines routinely reach 15%+ ABV.

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Advantages

- **Excellent drought/heat tolerance** — reduces irrigation needs
- Upright growth allows bush training without trellis
- Makes excellent rosé (earlier-drinking product while reds age)
- Forgiving viticulture in warm climates

### Challenges

- Shatter risk requires wind protection during bloom
- Oxidation demands careful cellar work
- High potential alcohol requires harvest timing attention
- Color extraction can be challenging (extended maceration needed)

### Beginner Accessibility

**Rating:** 1 — Moderate (Best Rhône red for beginners)

Grenache offers the best balance of climate resilience and forgiving viticulture among Rhône reds, though winemaking requires attention to oxidation management.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Climate:** Thrives in hot, dry conditions (Regions III-V)
2. **Drought:** HIGH tolerance — excellent for water-limited sites
3. **Training:** Bush vine/gobelet ideal; upright, self-supporting
4. **Bloom:** VERY sensitive to wind/cold — shatter risk
5. **Sugar:** Accumulates rapidly; harvest timing critical
6. **Winemaking:** HIGHLY oxidation-prone; protect from air
7. **Blending:** Provides fruit/body to GSM; complements reductive Mourvèdre
