---

## Disease Susceptibility

### Disease Matrix

| Disease | Susceptibility | Management Priority |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Powdery mildew** | MODERATE | Standard fungicide program |
| **Downy mildew** | MODERATE | California dry climate provides natural protection |
| **Botrytis bunch rot** | HIGH | CRITICAL concern—tight clusters |
| **Eutypa dieback** | RESISTANT | Notable resistance to wood-rotting diseases |
| **Phylloxera** | SUSCEPTIBLE | Requires rootstock except sandy soils |

### Botrytis Management (Critical)

**Infection conditions:** 60-75°F, free moisture, >90% humidity

**Key spray timings:**
1. Bloom
2. Bunch closure
3. Veraison
4. Pre-harvest

**Cultural controls:**
- Dormant sanitation pruning
- Gibberellic acid application for cluster loosening
- Aggressive leaf removal in fruit zone
- Shoot thinning to improve air circulation
- Clone selection (Primitivo-03 less prone to rot)

### Nutritional Vulnerabilities

|----------|----------|--------|
| **Leaf removal** | HIGH | Pre-veraison; ~50% bunch rot control |
| **Shoot thinning** | HIGH | Early season; reduce density |
| **Cluster thinning** | HIGH | Pre-bloom (clumps); post-set (shaded) |
| **Hedging** | MODERATE | Control vigor, improve air circulation |

### Uneven Ripening Management

**Causes:**
- Staggered flowering (7-10 days vs. typical 3-5)
- Temperature fluctuations during ripening
- Millerandage from cold/rainy bloom ("hens and chicks")
- Boron deficiency affecting fruit set uniformity
- High crop loads creating internal competition
- Canopy shading promoting bunch stem necrosis

**Management Strategies:**
1. Pre-bloom cluster thinning to reduce competition
2. Foliar P, B, Zn, Mo application at bloom
3. Post fruit-set RDI initiation
4. Clone selection (heritage clones with loose clusters)
5. Gibberellin application for cluster elongation
6. Aggressive leaf removal for light penetration
7. Shoot thinning to reduce crop load
8. Harvest at slightly high Brix to compensate for green berries
9. Multiple harvest passes (premium production)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Uneven ripening is THE signature challenge** — Extended flowering creates berries at different maturities; requires sorting or acceptance of mixed ripeness

2. **Botrytis pressure HIGH** — Tight clusters and thin skins demand full spray program and canopy management

3. **Best quality from stressed sites** — Moderate drought stress, low vigor, limited yields produce concentrated wines

4. **Head training is traditional** — No trellis needed; allows dry-farming and long vine life

5. **Own-rooted viable in sandy soils** — Lodi's sandy loams suppress phylloxera

6. **Blends well with Petite Sirah** — 5-25% PS adds color, structure, and aging potential

7. **Old vines are irreplaceable** — 50+ year vines produce concentrated, complex wines with terroir expression

8. **High Brix common** — 24-28° typical; monitor for stuck fermentation risk

9. **Heritage clones reduce rot** — Post-2009 selections have looser clusters than early FPS clones

10. **Climate dramatically shapes style** — Cool = elegant/red fruit; warm = jammy/high alcohol
