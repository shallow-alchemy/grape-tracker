## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Red/Blue-Black, Vitis labrusca |
| **Origin** | Concord, Massachusetts (1849) |
| **Parentage** | Selection from wild labrusca seedlings; ~1/3 vinifera ancestry |
| **Vigor** | Very High |
| **Ripening** | Mid to Late season (mid-September) |
| **Cold Hardiness** | Excellent (to -20°F / -29°C or colder) |

## Species Context: Vitis labrusca

Concord belongs to *Vitis labrusca*, the native North American "fox grape" species, which differs fundamentally from European *Vitis vinifera*:

| Characteristic | Labrusca (Concord) | Vinifera |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Skin type | Slip-skin (separates from pulp) | Adherent |
| Aroma | "Foxy" (methyl anthranilate) | Varies by variety |
| Cold hardiness | Excellent (-20°F+) | Poor to Moderate |
| Disease resistance | High | Low to Moderate |
| Tendrils | Every node | Every third node |

**The "Foxy" Flavor:** The characteristic labrusca aroma comes from methyl anthranilate, a volatile compound that accumulates in berry skins during ripening. This compound is used industrially to create artificial grape flavoring. While beloved in juice and jelly, foxiness is generally considered undesirable in wine.

## Climate Requirements

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| USDA Zones | 4–9 (best in 5–8) | Some sources list 3b–9a |
| Minimum winter temp | -20°F to -25°F (-29 to -32°C) | Without protection |
| Frost-free days | 150–180 | Requires adequate growing season |
| Ideal summer temps | 75–85°F (24–29°C) | Heat shutdown above 95°F |
| Chill hours | Requires cold winters | Poor performance without winter dormancy |

### Regional Performance

| Region | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Finger Lakes, NY | Excellent | Historic region; ideal climate |
| Lake Erie belt | Excellent | Lake-moderated; major production |
| Pacific Northwest | Good–Excellent | Washington State significant producer |
| Upper Midwest | Good | Cold hardiness allows cultivation |
| New England | Good | Historic home of Concord |
| Southeast | Poor | Pierce's disease, inadequate chill |
| California | Poor | Too warm, inadequate chill hours |
| Florida/Deep South | Poor | Humidity, heat, lack of winter chill |

## Phenology

| Stage | Timing | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Bud break | Mid-season | Less frost-susceptible than vinifera |
| Flowering | Early summer | Self-fertile |
| Veraison | Late summer | Berries turn blue-black |
| Harvest | Mid to late September | 150+ days from dormancy |
| Ripeness | 14–16°Brix typical | Lower sugar than wine grapes |

---

## Disease Susceptibility

| Disease | Rating | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Powdery mildew | LOW | Natural resistance from labrusca heritage |
| Downy mildew | MODERATE | Better than vinifera, monitor in wet years |
| Black rot | MODERATE | Can be problematic in humid regions |
| Phylloxera | LOW | Strong natural resistance |
| Pierce's disease | MODERATE | More tolerant than vinifera but not immune |

**Key advantage:** Concord's disease resistance makes it suitable for low-spray or organic production in many regions—a significant advantage over vinifera.

## Vineyard Management

### Vigor Characteristics

- **Rating:** Very High—aggressive, vigorous grower
- **Cane growth:** Willowy, downward-arching habit (unlike upright vinifera)
- **Canopy density:** Becomes jungle-like without management
- **Productivity:** Heavy bearer; cluster thinning rarely needed

### Spacing Guidelines

| Configuration | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Row spacing | 8–10 ft (2.4–3 m) |
| Vine spacing | 6–8 ft (1.8–2.4 m) |
| Trellis height | 5–6 ft (1.5–1.8 m) |

### Training System Compatibility

| System | Suitability | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Umbrella Kniffen | Excellent | Traditional system; accommodates downward growth |
| Four-Arm Kniffen | Excellent | Eastern US standard |
| Geneva Double Curtain | Good | For high-vigor sites |
| Hudson River Umbrella | Good | Accommodates vigorous growth |
| Head training | Poor | Too vigorous |
| VSP | Poor | Growth habit incompatible |

**Pruning:** Cane pruning strongly preferred. Leave 60+ buds per vine on mature plants for high-vigor management.

### Yield Expectations

| Level | Tons/Acre | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Commercial juice | 6–10 | Industry standard |
| Quality-focused | 4–6 | Better sugar concentration |
| Home vineyard | 15–25 lbs/vine | Mature, well-managed vines |

## Flavor Profile

### Fresh Fruit

- Intensely "grapey"—the flavor most Americans associate with grape
- Sweet with moderate acidity
- Pronounced methyl anthranilate (foxy/musky note)
- Slip-skin texture
- Deep blue-black color with whitish bloom

### Wine Characteristics

- Strong foxy character dominates
- Can be reduced through limited skin contact
- Best suited to sweet or semi-sweet styles
- Requires chaptalization (sugar addition) for adequate alcohol

## Winemaking Considerations

### Harvest Chemistry

| Parameter | Typical Value | Target for Wine |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Harvest Brix | 14–16° | Chapitalize to 22–24° |
| pH | 3.2–3.5 | — |
| TA | 8–12 g/L | May need adjustment |

### Managing Foxiness

1. **Limit skin contact:** Cold soak 2–10 hours only; press early
2. **Ferment as white:** Minimal skin contact produces lighter, less foxy wine
3. **Blend with non-foxy varieties:** Chambourcin or other hybrids can balance
4. **Residual sugar:** Sweetness masks foxy character effectively

**Slip-skin pressing tip:** Add rice hulls to must before pressing to improve juice extraction from slip-skin berries.

### Chaptalization

Concord's low natural sugar (14–16°Brix) requires sugar addition to achieve adequate alcohol for wine stability. Options include:
- Dry sugar addition (less predictable)
- Standard sugar solution (better control)
- Target: 22–24°Brix post-chaptalization

## Small-Scale Growing Notes

### Why Grow Concord

- Extremely reliable producer in cold climates
- Minimal spray program needed
- Makes excellent juice, jelly, and sweet wine
- Historic American variety (introduced 1849)
- Most widely planted grape east of Rockies
- 20+ year productive lifespan

### Challenges

- Wine quality limited by foxy character
- Very vigorous—requires substantial trellis and pruning
- Later ripening limits northern range
- Lower sugar requires chaptalization for wine

### Equipment Needs

- Strong trellis system (high-tensile wire recommended)
- Pruning tools for heavy annual cuts
- Juice press or steam juicer for processing

### Timeline Expectations

| Year | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Year 1–2 | Vine establishment, no fruit |
| Year 3 | Light first crop (remove most clusters) |
| Year 4+ | Full production (15–25 lbs/vine possible) |

**Wine yield:** ~1 gallon per 15–18 lbs fruit

### Practical Tips

1. **Build strong trellis first**—Concord will test any weak points
2. **Plan for vigor**—Allow adequate space between vines
3. **Prune heavily**—Don't be timid; Concord responds well
4. **Harvest timing**—Taste berries; don't rely only on Brix readings
5. **Process promptly**—Slip-skin berries don't store well

## Historic Significance

Concord was developed in 1849 by Ephraim Wales Bull in Concord, Massachusetts, from native labrusca seedlings. Despite containing approximately one-third vinifera genetics in its ancestry, it expresses predominantly labrusca characteristics.

**Industry impact:**
- Most widely planted grape variety east of the Rocky Mountains
- Foundation of American grape juice industry (Welch's)
- Standard for grape jelly and jam production
- Genetic parent of many cold-hardy hybrid varieties

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cold hardiness:** Survives -20°F to -25°F—reliable where vinifera fails
2. **Disease resistance:** Low spray requirements compared to vinifera
3. **Vigor:** Extremely vigorous; requires curtain/umbrella training systems
4. **Foxiness:** Defining characteristic—beloved in juice, challenging in wine
5. **Sugar:** Low natural Brix requires chaptalization for wine
6. **Training:** VSP incompatible; use Kniffen or umbrella systems
7. **Best use:** Juice, jelly, sweet wine; dry wine challenging
