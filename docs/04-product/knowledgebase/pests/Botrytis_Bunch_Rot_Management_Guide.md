## Overview

**Botrytis is unique among grape diseases because the same fungus that destroys commercial crops can, under specific conditions, create the world's most prized dessert wines.** The difference lies entirely in humidity cycling: sustained wetness produces destructive bunch rot, while alternating moist mornings and dry afternoons create noble rot (used for Sauternes, Tokaji, Trockenbeerenauslese). For most growers, Botrytis is the enemy—particularly threatening tight-clustered varieties in wet harvest seasons.

**Causal organism:** *Botrytis cinerea* (gray mold), a necrotrophic fungus with extremely wide host range (affects 200+ plant species).

**The fundamental truth:** Fungicide programs alone often fail without cultural practices. Best fungicides cannot compensate for poor canopy management. **Leaf removal is the single most effective intervention.**

## Identification

### Symptoms through the season

**Early bloom (blossom blight):**
- Inflorescences turn brown and desiccated
- Gray-brownish mycelium visible on flower parts
- Infections in leaf axils cause shoots to wilt or break

**Slip-skin stage (latent—no visible symptoms):**
- Infections from bloom remain dormant until veraison
- Fungus colonizes dead flower parts ("blossom trash") trapped within clusters
- Waiting to activate when sugars rise

**Post-veraison bunch rot (the destructive phase):**
- White cultivars: Berries turn brown and shriveled
- Red cultivars: Develop reddish discoloration before browning
- Individual infected berries serve as starting points for berry-to-berry spread
- Classic **gray, velvety fungal growth** covers berry surfaces under high humidity
- "Slip skin"—berry skin separates easily from pulp when touched

### The noble rot distinction

| Factor | **Destructive bunch rot** | **Noble rot (desirable)** |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Weather pattern | Consistently wet/humid | Morning mist → warm, dry afternoon |
| Humidity cycling | >80% sustained | Drops below 60% after infection |
| Berry condition | Swell, split, burst | Shrivel, concentrate sugars |
| Skin integrity | Splits open, juice leaks | Pierced but intact |
| Result | Fermentation problems, off-flavors | Sauternes, Tokaji, TBA |

**Noble rot mechanism:** Initial infection requires ~85-95% RH for maximum 24 hours, then humidity must drop below 60% to halt fungal growth. The fungus pierces berry skin without splitting it, allowing water evaporation. Berries can lose up to 60% of weight, concentrating sugars to 350-450 g/L.

### Distinguishing from sour rot

| Feature | Botrytis bunch rot | Sour rot |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Appearance | Gray, fuzzy mold growth | No mold; tan/brown, slimy berries |
| Smell | Earthy/musty | Strong vinegar (acetic acid) |
| Cause | *B. cinerea* alone | Yeasts + bacteria + Drosophila flies |
| Insects | Not involved | Fruit flies essential |
| Treatment | Botrytis fungicides | Insecticide + antimicrobial |

## Conditions That Favor Development

### Environmental thresholds

| Temperature | Infection potential |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 53°F (12°C) | Minimum for infection |
| **59-77°F (15-25°C)** | **OPTIMAL** |
| 86°F (30°C) | Upper limit; slows infection |
| >90°F (32°C) | Dries infection; causes raisining instead |

**Moisture requirements:**
- Free water required for spore germination
- Infection can occur with as little as **4 hours berry wetness**
- Relative humidity **>92%** favors late-season infections
- Morning dew can provide sufficient moisture

### The latent infection problem

**Flowers infected at bloom harbor dormant infections until veraison.** The fungus enters through:
- Stigma during bloom
- Cap scars after cap fall
- Senescing flower parts

It colonizes dead floral tissue as food base, remaining quiescent until sugar increases and acid decreases at veraison. **If pre-harvest weather is dry, latent infections may cause little damage.** This explains year-to-year variability in the same vineyard—bloom infections + dry harvest = low rot; bloom infections + wet harvest = severe rot.

### Two critical infection periods

**1. BLOOM (most important for preventing latent infections):**
- Cap scars and exposed flower tissues provide entry
- Fungus colonizes dead floral tissue as food base
- **Bloom sprays protect against infections that won't appear until harvest**

**2. VERAISON THROUGH HARVEST (active disease phase):**
- Rising sugar activates latent infections
- Berry-to-berry spread is rapid within tight clusters
- Weather determines severity

### Entry points that increase risk

Any wound or damage increases Botrytis susceptibility:
- **Insects:** Grape berry moth larvae, wasps, yellow jackets
- **Birds:** Feeding damage creates wounds
- **Hail:** Mechanical damage to skins
- **Powdery mildew:** Prior infection weakens berry skin
- **Berry splitting:** From rain, irrigation, or growth pressure
- **Sunburn:** Damaged skin is entry point

### Why rain near harvest is devastating

1. Berries are maximally susceptible due to high sugar content
2. Ripening berries crack easily, providing entry points
3. Fungus spreads rapidly berry-to-berry in tight clusters
4. Short window to harvest before severe losses
5. **PHI restrictions may prevent fungicide application**

## Prevention

### Cultural practices trump fungicides

**This cannot be overstated:** In Botrytis management, cultural practices are more important than spray programs. You cannot spray your way out of a tight-clustered, shaded canopy.

### Leaf pulling: The single most effective intervention

**Timing options:**

| Timing | Effectiveness | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Bloom to fruit set (BBCH 71-75)** | **OPTIMAL** | Berries acclimate; develop thicker cuticle |
| Before BBCH 71 | May decrease fruit set | Not recommended |
| After pea-size | Less effective for Botrytis | Still helps spray coverage |
| Late season | Risk of sunburn | Only after heat threat passes |

**Research results:**
- Single-sided or double-sided early leaf removal eliminated PM and Botrytis in trials
- Reduced bunch rot incidence by 23-48% compared to no removal
- Early removal on both sides: 15% rot vs 48% control in Vignoles study

**How many leaves to remove:**
- 2-4 leaves per shoot in the cluster zone
- On **one side** of canopy (see below)
- Goal: clusters should be **visible** from outside the canopy

**Which side (critical):**
- **Morning-sun side preferred** (east or north exposure)
- Avoid afternoon sun exposure in hot climates (west/south) to prevent sunburn
- In cooler climates (PNW, Great Lakes), double-sided removal may be acceptable
- Adapt to your site's sun exposure and heat

### Cluster architecture: The built-in risk factor

**Tight clusters trap moisture between berries, prevent spray penetration, and allow rapid berry-to-berry spread.** Once one berry is infected, direct contact spreads disease throughout the cluster.

**High-risk tight-clustered varieties:**
- Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris
- Chardonnay
- Riesling
- Vignoles
- Chenin Blanc

**Lower-risk loose-clustered varieties:**
- Cabernet Sauvignon (one of least susceptible)
- Petit Verdot
- Cabernet Franc
- Grenache

### Cluster loosening with GA

For tight-cluster varieties, gibberellic acid (GA) sprays can elongate the rachis and reduce cluster compactness.

**Timing:** 3 weeks pre-bloom (when shoots are 12-18 inches)
**Product:** ProGibb LV Plus
**Rate:** 0.5-1 fl oz/100 gal
**Results:** Reduced Botrytis 40-50% in Vignoles/Chardonnay trials

### Other cultural practices

**Canopy management:**
- Shoot positioning for open canopy
- Hedging to prevent excessive shading
- Avoiding excess nitrogen (promotes dense growth)

**Harvest timing:**
- **Do not leave fruit hanging in wet weather**
- Monitor forecasts closely approaching harvest
- Rising Brix + rain forecast = decision point
- **Better to harvest slightly early than lose crop to rot**
- Economic threshold: 5% bunch area diseased is typical limit for wineries

**Sanitation:**
- Remove mummified clusters during dormant pruning
- These harbor overwintering sclerotia
- Remove infected clusters when spotted during season

## Treatment

### Organic/OMRI-approved products

| Product | Active | PHI | Efficacy | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----|----------|-------|
| Serenade ASO/Opti | *Bacillus subtilis* QST 713 | 0 days | Moderate | Tank-mix, don't rely on alone |
| Botector | *Aureobasidium pullulans* | 0 days | Moderate-Good | 57% reduction in some trials |
| Stargus | *B. amyloliquefaciens* F727 | 0 days | Moderate | |
| Double Nickel | *B. amyloliquefaciens* D747 | 0 days | Moderate | |
| MilStop/Kaligreen | Potassium bicarbonate | 0 days | Limited | Better for PM |

**Organic program reality:**
- Biological agents achieved 21-58% disease reduction in trials
- Must be applied **preventatively** before infection
- **Cultural controls are even MORE critical** in organic programs
- Excellent canopy management is non-negotiable for organic Botrytis control

### Conventional fungicides by FRAC group

**Best efficacy products:**

| Product | FRAC | Rate | PHI | Efficacy |
|---------|------|------|-----|----------|
| **Elevate 50 WDG** | 17 | 1 lb/A | 0 days | Excellent (protective + curative) |
| **Switch** | 9+12 | Label | 7 days | Excellent |
| **Endura** | 7 | 8 oz/A | 14 days | Good-Excellent |
| **Vangard** | 9 | Label | — | Excellent (avoid summer heat) |
| **Scala** | 9 | Label | — | Excellent (curative against latent) |
| Intuity | 11 | Label | 10 days | Good (new strobilurin) |

**Strobilurins (FRAC 11):** Pristine, Abound, Flint have suppressive activity only—not recommended as primary Botrytis control due to resistance. Exception: Intuity showed good control in Cornell trials.

### ⚠️ Resistance management is critical

**Botrytis cinerea has HIGH resistance risk.** Resistance develops quickly because the fungus reproduces rapidly and has many generations per season.

**California Central Coast 2020-2021 resistance survey:**

| Active ingredient | FRAC | % Populations resistant |
|-------------------|------|------------------------|
| Pyrimethanil | 9 | 81-94% |
| Trifloxystrobin | 11 | 97-100% |
| Boscalid | 7 | 77% |
| Fenhexamid | 17 | 8-25% |
| **Fludioxonil** | **12** | **0% (still sensitive)** |
| **Iprodione** | **2** | **0% (still sensitive)** |

**Resistance management rules:**
1. Rotate FRAC groups for every application
2. Never apply same FRAC twice consecutively
3. Limit single-site fungicides to **2 applications maximum per FRAC group per season**
4. **The best resistance management is to spray less** by using cultural practices

### Spray timing: The 4-application maximum

| Timing | Target | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **1. BLOOM** | Latent flower infections | **Most critical** |
| **2. Pre-bunch closure** | Interior cluster protection | **Last chance to reach inside cluster** |
| **3. Veraison** | Active infection prevention | Important |
| **4. Pre-harvest** | Outbreak prevention | Only if wet + PHI allows |

**More than 4 applications rarely justified economically.**

In dry seasons with good cultural practices, fewer sprays may be adequate:
- Dry year + good canopy: 1-2 sprays (bloom + veraison)
- Average year: 2-3 sprays
- Wet year: Full 4-spray program

## Regional Considerations

### High-pressure regions

**Pacific Northwest:**
- Botrytis is the most common fruit rot
- Pinot Noir at highest risk due to variety + climate
- Cool, wet falls are common
- 4-spray programs often necessary

**Great Lakes/Northeast:**
- High humidity, variable summers
- 4-7 applications in high-pressure years
- Tight-clustered hybrids (Vignoles) especially vulnerable

**Coastal fog areas (CA, OR):**
- Morning fog without afternoon drying creates ideal conditions
- Even "dry" climates can have Botrytis issues near coast

### Lower-pressure regions

**California Central Valley:**
- Typically drier, lower pressure
- Hot temperatures suppress Botrytis
- May need minimal sprays except in wet years

**Mediterranean climates:**
- Generally lower pressure
- Harvest typically occurs in dry period
- Late-rain years are the exception

### Vintage weather effects

**The same vineyard can vary from 0% rot to 50%+ rot year-to-year based solely on harvest-season weather.**

- Wet years need full spray program + aggressive cultural practices
- Dry years may need no Botrytis sprays at all
- Watch forecasts and adjust accordingly

## Varietal Susceptibility

### By cluster architecture

| Risk level | Varieties | Key factor |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Very High** | Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Riesling, Vignoles | Tight clusters + thin skin |
| **High** | Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc | Tight clusters |
| **Moderate** | Gewürztraminer | Less compact than above |
| **Low** | Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cab Franc | Loose clusters + thick skin |

### Clone selection matters

Within varieties (especially Pinot Noir), clones vary significantly in cluster tightness:
- Dijon clones tend toward tighter clusters
- Some heritage clones have looser architecture
- Ask nurseries about clone characteristics when ordering

### Variety choice for problem sites

If you have a site with chronic Botrytis pressure (fog, late rains, poor air drainage):
- Consider loose-clustered varieties
- Avoid Pinot Noir, Riesling, Vignoles
- Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot are much easier to manage

## Season-long spray program example

**For susceptible varieties (Pinot, Chardonnay) in moderate-pressure regions:**

| Timing | Product | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Bloom** | Elevate or Switch | **Most critical—prevents latent infections** |
| **Pre-bunch closure** | Rotate FRAC group | Last spray that reaches inside cluster |
| **Veraison** | Rotate FRAC group | Activating latent infections |
| **Pre-harvest** | Elevate (0-day PHI) | Only if wet weather threatens |

**Adjustments:**
- Dry forecast through harvest: Skip spray 4
- Very dry year: May reduce to bloom + veraison only
- Wet year: Consider adding post-bloom spray (5 total)
- Excellent canopy + leaf removal: Can reduce frequency

**For low-susceptibility varieties (Cabernet Sauvignon) or dry climates:**
- Often need only 1-2 sprays (bloom + veraison if wet)
- Some years may need no Botrytis sprays
- Focus on powdery mildew instead

## Economic thresholds and harvest decisions

### When to harvest despite some rot

**5% infected berries:** Typical industry threshold for acceptance
**10% infected berries:** Quality impact noticeable; harvest immediately
**>15% infected berries:** Significant quality problems; sort aggressively

### The harvest decision

When you see:
- Rain in forecast during final ripening
- Botrytis appearing in clusters
- Brix at minimally acceptable levels

**Consider harvesting immediately rather than waiting for optimal ripeness.** A slightly underripe wine is better than a Botrytis-tainted wine.

### Sorting at harvest

- Hand-sort clusters, removing infected portions
- Or: Harvest entire vineyard and sort at crush pad
- Optical sorting available at some custom crush facilities
- Even with sorting, heavily infected lots may have off-flavors

## Key takeaways

1. **Cultural practices are more important than sprays**—you cannot spray your way out of poor canopy management
2. **Leaf pulling is the single most effective intervention**—early removal (bloom to fruit set) is optimal
3. **Tight clusters are inherently high-risk**—variety choice matters enormously
4. **Bloom spray is most critical**—prevents latent infections that activate at harvest
5. **Resistance is a serious problem**—rotate FRAC groups and limit applications
6. **Weather determines severity**—wet harvest = problems; dry harvest = minimal issues
7. **Harvest decisions are economic**—better slightly early than rot-damaged
8. **4 sprays maximum in most years**—more is rarely justified economically
