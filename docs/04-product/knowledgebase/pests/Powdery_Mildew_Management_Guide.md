## Overview

**Powdery mildew is the most economically significant fungal disease of grapes globally, accounting for 74% of grape pesticide use in California alone.** Unlike most fungal diseases, it does not require free water for infection—only moderate humidity (40-100% RH)—which explains its universal presence across all grape-growing climates. No vineyard is immune.

**Causal organism:** *Erysiphe necator* (formerly *Uncinula necator*), an obligate biotroph that survives only on living grapevine tissue.

**Wine quality impact:** As little as 3-5% infected berries creates detectable off-flavors (oily, moldy, bitter, dusty character).

## Identification

### Symptoms by plant part

**Leaves:**
- Early: Chlorotic (yellow) spots with webby white mycelium on lower surface
- Progressive: Powdery white patches covering entire surfaces
- Late season: Darkened colonies with tiny black dots (chasmothecia)
- Infected expanding leaves become distorted, stunted, and may curl upward

**Shoots:**
- Dark brown to black feathery patches on green tissue
- Reddish-brown blotches visible on dormant canes (evidence of previous season infection)

**Berries and clusters:**
- White powdery masses that can colonize entire berry surfaces
- Mature fruit develops black-to-brown web scarring from former colonies
- Infected berries become misshapen, develop rusty spots, and may crack
- Red cultivars fail to color properly, showing blotchy appearance

### Flag shoots: Critical early-season indicator

**Flag shoots emerge from infected dormant buds where the fungus overwintered as mycelium.** They are the most important early-season indicator:

- Appear stunted with delayed budbreak
- Covered in white-to-gray powdery growth
- Yellowed, up-curled leaves
- Some show only thin threads, making detection difficult
- Produce conidia that initiate early-season epidemics

**Action:** Scout for flag shoots from budbreak through 6-inch shoot growth. Remove and destroy any found—this significantly reduces inoculum pressure for the entire season.

### Distinguishing from lookalikes

| Problem | Key difference |
|---------|----------------|
| Spray residue | PM can be rubbed off; 10x magnification reveals branching hyphae |
| Downy mildew | DM shows yellow "oil spots" on upper surface with sporulation on UNDERSIDE only |
| Erineum mite | Creates puckered blisters on leaf tops; PM has no blisters |
| Sunscald | Causes bronzing/browning without fungal growth |

---

## Conditions That Favor Development

### Why powdery mildew doesn't need free water

**This is the defining characteristic separating PM from other grape diseases.** Conidia germinate in 40-100% relative humidity without requiring leaf wetness. Rainfall actually harms the fungus—conidia burst in water and get washed off colonies. High humidity (70-85%) is optimal for reproduction.

### Temperature thresholds

| Condition | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------|
| Minimum for ascospore release | 50°F (10°C) |
| Minimum for conidial infection | 59°F (15°C) |
| **Optimal for growth/reproduction** | **68-77°F (20-25°C)** |
| Maximum for infection | 90°F (32°C) |
| Kills fungus | Above 104°F (40°C) |
| Slows epidemic | 95°F+ for 12+ continuous hours |

### Disease cycle

**Overwintering sources:**
- **Primary:** Chasmothecia (black spherical fruiting bodies, 0.1-0.3mm) wash onto bark during fall/winter rains and overwinter in bark crevices
- **Secondary:** Mycelium in dormant buds infected 4-6 weeks after shoot growth, producing flag shoots the following spring

**Latent period:** From infection to visible symptoms: 7-14 days typically; as short as 3 days under optimal conditions.

**Berry susceptibility:** Drops rapidly after 4 weeks post-bloom. No new fruit infections occur after 8% Brix.

### UC Davis Powdery Mildew Risk Index

| Index | Pressure | Reproduction rate |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 0-30 | Low | Present but slow |
| 40-50 | Moderate | Every 15 days |
| 60+ | High | Every 5 days |

**Epidemic trigger:** 3 consecutive days with 6+ continuous hours at 70-85°F brings index to 60+.

## Prevention

### Canopy management fundamentals

**Open canopies provide three-fold protection:** better spray coverage, UV light exposure (kills spores), and faster drying. Research shows leaf removal alone provides approximately 50% disease control.

**Key practices:**
- **Shoot thinning:** Remove suckers, doubles, laterals, and basal buds in April/early May
- **Leaf pulling:** Remove fruit-zone leaves from bloom to pea-size for airflow and dappled light; early removal causes no yield reduction or sunburn
- **Nitrogen management:** Avoid excess N (promotes succulent growth); stop applications after early July

### Site considerations

- Good air drainage reduces humidity in canopy
- Full sun exposure—UV light damages spores
- Avoid tight-clustered varieties in humid regions if possible
- Match rootstock to site to prevent excessive vigor

### Sanitation

- Remove and destroy flag shoots when found
- Post-harvest: Remove mummified clusters
- Dormant season: Consider lime-sulfur application to reduce overwintering chasmothecia

## Treatment

### Sulfur: The organic cornerstone

**Sulfur remains the foundation of powdery mildew control, with no documented resistance after 150+ years of use.** Its multi-site mode of action prevents resistance development.

| Sulfur type | Rate per acre | Small-scale equivalent |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Wettable sulfur | 3-10 lb | 1-4 Tbsp per gallon |
| Microthiol Disperss (80%) | 3-10 lb | 1-3.5 oz per 100 gal |
| Micronized/flowable | 3-10 lb | Per label |

**Oregon State reduced-rate research:** 2 lb/100 gal provided equal leaf control to 8 lb/100 gal; 4 lb/100 gal sufficient for fruit control.

### ⚠️ Critical sulfur temperature limits

| Concern | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| **Phytotoxicity risk begins** | **>85°F (30°C)** |
| High phytotoxicity risk | >86°F with >70-75% humidity |
| Hybrid variety damage | As low as 75°F for sensitive varieties |
| **Never apply above** | **90°F** |
| After oil application | Wait minimum 14 days |

**Sulfur-sensitive varieties (limit or avoid):** Marechal Foch, Leon Millot, Brianna, Concord-type *V. labrusca*, LaCrescent, St. Croix.

**Wine quality consideration:** Sulfur may cause hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) off-flavors. Cutoff: 30 days before white wine harvest; 50 days before red.

### Other organic options

| Product | Rate | Key notes |
|---------|------|-----------|
| JMS Stylet Oil | 1-2 gal/100 gal water | Eradicant; do not use within 2 weeks of sulfur; avoid >90°F |
| Kaligreen/MilStop | 2.5-5 lb/A | Potassium bicarbonate; best early season |
| Serenade OPTI | 14-20 oz/A | Tank-mix with sulfur; ineffective alone |
| Milk sprays | 10-40% dilution | Home remedy with some efficacy; apply in sunshine |

**Biological controls** (Bacillus subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens) are not recommended as standalone programs—use as rotational partners with sulfur at 7-day intervals.

### Conventional fungicides by FRAC group

**DMI fungicides (FRAC 3):**
- Rally (myclobutanil): 3-5 oz/A
- Elite (tebuconazole): 4 oz/A
- Mettle: 3-5 fl oz/A
- **PHI: 14 days**
- ⚠️ Resistance documented in OR, WA, NY—always tank-mix with sulfur

**Strobilurins (FRAC 11):**
- Abound: 10-15.5 fl oz/A
- Flint Extra: 3-3.5 fl oz/A
- **PHI: 14 days**
- ⚠️ Widespread resistance—do not use on Concord; avoid silicone surfactants

**Other single-site options:**
- Quintec (FRAC 13): 4-6.6 fl oz/A, PHI 21 days
- Vivando (FRAC 50): 10.3-15.4 fl oz/A, PHI 14 days

**Combination products:**
- Pristine (FRAC 7+11): 8-12.5 oz/A
- Luna Experience (FRAC 3+7): 6-8.6 fl oz/A
- Not for Concord/labrusca types

### Resistance management protocol

1. **Rotate FRAC groups**—never more than 2 consecutive applications of same group
2. **Tank-mix** single-site products with sulfur or contact fungicides
3. **Documented resistance:** FRAC 3, 7, 11, and 13 in various regions
4. **Sulfur has NO resistance issues**—use as program backbone

### Spray timing by phenological stage

| Growth stage | Priority | Interval |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| 6-inch shoot growth | High - begin program | — |
| **Pre-bloom through bloom** | **CRITICAL** | 7 days |
| Fruit set to 2-4 weeks post-bloom | Critical | 7-10 days |
| 8% Brix | Moderate - no new fruit infection | 14 days |
| 12% Brix (wine grapes) | Can discontinue fruit protection | — |

**Interval guidelines:** 7 days high pressure; 10-14 days moderate; 14-21 days low.

## Regional Considerations

**California/Mediterranean:** Early-season pressure from chasmothecia; dry summers and heat (>95°F) provide natural suppression. Use UC Davis Risk Index. Coast regions have most severe pressure.

**Pacific Northwest:** Severe west of Cascades; strong resistance to FRAC 3, 7, 11 documented. Do not extend intervals past 2 weeks in Willamette Valley.

**Continental/Great Lakes:** Later season start; post-harvest sprays important to reduce overwintering inoculum. Uncontrolled PM reduces winter hardiness.

**Humid Southeast:** Challenging due to humidity; may require more frequent applications when humidity exceeds 75%.

**High Desert:** Lower pressure due to low humidity and temperature extremes, but still requires management.

## Varietal Susceptibility

| Category | Varieties | Spray intensity |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Highly susceptible** | Chardonnay, Carignane, Pinot Noir, Cab Sauv, Merlot, Riesling | 10-15 sprays/year |
| **Moderately susceptible** | Most French-American hybrids | 5-10 sprays/year |
| **Resistant/tolerant** | Frontenac, Marquette, Itasca, Concord (but sulfur-sensitive) | 3-5 sprays/year |

---

## Season-long spray program example

**For susceptible vinifera in moderate-pressure regions:**

| Timing | Product | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 6" shoots | Sulfur | Begin program |
| Pre-bloom | Sulfur | 7-day interval |
| Bloom | Sulfur + DMI or strobilurin | Critical timing |
| Post-bloom +7 days | Sulfur | |
| Post-bloom +14 days | Sulfur + rotate FRAC | |
| Post-bloom +21 days | Sulfur | Berry susceptibility declining |
| Veraison | Sulfur or synthetic (observe PHI) | Last application if needed |

**Adjustments:**
- High pressure: Shorten intervals to 7 days
- Low pressure: Extend to 14-21 days
- Resistant varieties: Reduce frequency by 30-50%
- Excellent canopy management: Can reduce spray frequency
