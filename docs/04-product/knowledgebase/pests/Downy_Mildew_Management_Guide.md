## Overview

**Downy mildew is devastating in humid Eastern climates yet virtually absent in dry California summers—a single factor explains this difference: the disease cannot infect without free water on leaf surfaces.** This oomycete (water mold, not true fungus) is native to eastern North America and was introduced to Europe in 1878, where it devastated vineyards until the discovery of Bordeaux mixture (copper sulfate + lime).

**Causal organism:** *Plasmopara viticola*, an oomycete more closely related to brown algae than true fungi.

**Climate dependency:** If you garden in a dry summer climate (California, High Desert, eastern Pacific Northwest), downy mildew is typically not a significant concern. In humid climates (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Great Lakes), it requires serious attention.

## Identification

### The "oil spot" signature (diagnostic)

**Upper leaf surface:**
- Early: Small greenish-yellow translucent spots
- Classic: Circular to irregular pale-yellow spots with an oily/greasy appearance
- Size: Enlarging to ¼ inch or more
- Older leaves: Lesions become angular and vein-limited (mosaic pattern)
- Late stage: Lesions turn reddish-brown, then necrotic

**Underside of leaves (the key diagnostic feature):**
- White, cottony/downy sporulation (sporangia) during humid conditions
- Appears when temperatures exceed 55°F (13°C)
- **This white growth can be wiped off with fingers—a key diagnostic test**
- Sporulation appears 5-17 days after infection

**Shoots and tendrils:**
- Tips thicken and curl into characteristic **"Shepherd's Crook"** shape
- Become covered with white sporulation
- Turn brown and die

**Berries:**
- "Gray rot" stage: Berries covered with white fungal felt, soft and shattering easily
- "Brown rot" stage (late infection via rachis): Firm berries with no sporulation that drop easily

### Distinguishing from powdery mildew

| Feature | Downy Mildew | Powdery Mildew |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Sporulation location** | **UNDERSIDE of leaves only** | Both surfaces, predominantly upper |
| Upper leaf symptom | Yellow "oil spots" | White powdery coating |
| Water requirement | Requires free water | Does not need free water |
| White growth texture | Cottony/downy | Powdery/dusty |

**Critical distinction:** Downy mildew sporulates through stomata on the leaf underside; powdery mildew grows superficially on both surfaces.

## Conditions That Favor Development

### The 10-10-10 rule for primary infection

**For spring infection from overwintered oospores, ALL three conditions must be met simultaneously:**
- Temperature: Minimum **10°C (50°F)**
- Rainfall: At least **10 mm (0.4 inches)**
- Shoot growth: At least **10 cm (4 inches)**

**Plus:** Free water on leaf surface is **ESSENTIAL**. Infection occurs through stomata on leaf undersides and can complete in as little as 90 minutes.

### Environmental thresholds

| Parameter | Optimal | Minimum | Maximum |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Temperature | 64-77°F (18-25°C) | 50°F (10°C) | 86°F (30°C) |
| Leaf wetness | Prolonged | 2-3 hours | — |
| Humidity for sporulation | >95% | — | — |
| Night temp for sporulation | >55°F (13°C) | — | — |

### Latent period

- **Optimal conditions:** 4-7 days from infection to visible symptoms
- **Cooler/warmer conditions:** 7-17 days

### Why climate determines everything

**High-risk regions (requires intensive management):**
- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Great Lakes
- Regular rainfall during growing season
- High humidity and heavy dews
- Warm nights promote sporulation
- Typically requires 7-8+ fungicide applications per season

**Low-risk regions (minimal management needed):**
- California Central Valley and most of CA
- High Desert (UT, CO, NM, AZ)
- Pacific Northwest east of Cascades
- Limited growing-season rainfall
- Low humidity, rapid leaf drying
- Downy mildew is often not a significant problem—focus spray programs on powdery mildew instead

## Prevention

### Site selection is paramount

**For downy mildew, site selection is more important than for powdery mildew:**
- Well-drained soils; avoid low-lying areas prone to water pooling
- Open sites with good airflow; avoid enclosed valleys
- Full sun for rapid foliage drying
- Sloped sites facilitate air drainage and cold air movement away from vines

### Irrigation management (critical)

**Drip irrigation strongly preferred**—keeps foliage dry.

**If using overhead/sprinkler irrigation:**
- Creates ideal infection conditions—avoid if possible
- If unavoidable, irrigate early enough to allow complete drying before nightfall
- **Never irrigate in late afternoon/evening**

### Canopy management

- Open canopies dry faster after rain/dew
- Leaf pulling in fruit zone improves air circulation
- Shoot positioning prevents leaf layering
- Hedging maintains manageable canopy size

### Sanitation for inoculum reduction

Oospores overwinter in fallen infected leaves on the vineyard floor.

**Reducing overwintering inoculum:**
- Flail-mow vineyard floor to accelerate leaf decomposition
- Shallow cultivation to bury leaves before budbreak
- Remove mummified berries and infected prunings
- Post-harvest fungicide application if disease was present

## Treatment

### Copper-based fungicides (primary organic option)

Copper has been the cornerstone of downy mildew control since 1885 (Bordeaux mixture discovery).

| Product type | Examples | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| Copper hydroxide | Kocide 3000, Champ, Badge | "Fixed" copper—lower phytotoxicity |
| Copper sulfate | Bordeaux mixture | Original fungicide; highly effective |
| Copper octanoate | Cueva | Low copper content; reduced phytotoxicity |

**Kocide 3000 rate:** 0.75-1.75 lb/acre; max 66.7 lb/season

### ⚠️ Copper phytotoxicity management

**Higher phytotoxicity risk:**
- Cool, wet, slow-drying weather
- Spray water pH <6.5
- Young, tender tissue

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Add hydrated lime (0.5-3 lb/100 gal spray solution)
- Apply when rapid drying is expected
- Reduce rates on young vines

**Never mix:** Copper and phosphorous acid products (incompatible)

**Long-term concern:** Copper accumulates in soil. EU has imposed restrictions. Monitor soil copper levels in long-term organic vineyards.

### Phosphorous acid products (systemic option)

**Products:** Prophyt, Phostrol, Rampart (FRAC P07)
**Rate:** 2.5-5 pt/A
**PHI:** 0 days

**Key advantages:**
- Systemic activity—moves within plant
- Both protective AND curative (post-infection activity)
- Antisporulant activity
- For curative effect, apply "booster spray" 5 days after initial application

### Conventional fungicides

**Protectant backbone (low resistance risk):**

| Product | FRAC | Rate | PHI | Notes |
|---------|------|------|-----|-------|
| Mancozeb | M3 | 1.5-4 lb/A | **66 days** | Long PHI limits late-season use |
| Captan | M4 | 1.25-2.5 lb/A | 0 days | Good late-season option |

**CAA fungicides (FRAC 40):**
- Revus, Forum, Zampro
- ⚠️ **Resistance documented in VA, NC; becoming common in NY**
- Do not rely on FRAC 40 alone
- Max 3 applications/season

**Phenylamides (FRAC 4):**
- Ridomil Gold products
- **Strongest curative activity** of any class
- ⚠️ Very high resistance risk
- Use only for rescue situations
- Always tank-mix with protectant

**Strobilurins (FRAC 11):**
- Abound is most active against DM
- ⚠️ Widespread resistance documented
- **Not recommended for DM control in most regions**

### Resistance management

1. **Rotate FRAC groups**—don't use same group consecutively
2. **Tank-mix** single-site fungicides with copper or mancozeb
3. **Limit** single-site materials to 2-3 applications per season
4. **Copper and mancozeb have no resistance issues**—use as program backbone

### Spray timing protocol

| Growth stage | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| 4-6" shoots | Begin protectant program if DM history/risk |
| Pre-bloom | Critical—continue protection |
| **Bloom** | **Highest susceptibility period** |
| 2-3 weeks post-bloom | Berries remain highly susceptible |
| 3-4 weeks post-bloom | Berries become resistant |
| Post-harvest | Apply if disease present to reduce overwintering inoculum |

**Spray intervals:**
- High pressure (wet weather): 7-10 days
- Moderate: 10-14 days
- Low: 14-21 days

**Rule of thumb:** Reapply after 2 inches of rain or 2 weeks, whichever comes first.

### Post-infection rescue

If caught after rain/infection event (within 24-72 hours):
1. **Best:** Ridomil Gold products (strongest curative)
2. **Good:** Phosphorous acid products + booster spray at 5 days
3. **Do NOT rely** solely on FRAC 11 or FRAC 40 (resistance issues)

## Regional Considerations

### When intensive DM management is justified

- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Great Lakes
- Years with wet springs/summers
- Vinifera varieties in humid climates
- History of DM in vineyard

### When minimal DM management is needed

- California/Mediterranean climates (most years)
- High Desert regions
- Pacific Northwest east of Cascades
- Arid/semi-arid regions with minimal summer rainfall
- Dry years anywhere
- American/Muscadine varieties with natural resistance

### Regional spray program intensity

| Region | Typical sprays/season | Primary products |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| Northeast/Great Lakes | 7-10 | Copper, mancozeb, phosphorous acids |
| Southeast | 8-12 | Copper, phosphorous acids, rotation |
| Midwest | 6-10 | Copper, mancozeb |
| California | 0-2 | Typically not needed |
| High Desert | 0-2 | Typically not needed |

## Varietal Susceptibility

| Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Highly susceptible** | All *Vitis vinifera*: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cab Sauv, Merlot, Riesling | Full spray program required in humid climates |
| **Moderately susceptible** | *V. labrusca* types | Some tolerance but still needs protection |
| **Resistant** | *V. rotundifolia* (Muscadine) | Highly resistant |
| **Resistant cold-climate varieties** | Itasca (high), Marquette (moderate), Frontenac (good) | Reduced spray needs |

### Resistance breeding

- 33+ resistance genes (Rpv loci) identified across wild Vitis species
- New breeding programs incorporate multiple resistance genes
- Consider resistant varieties for organic production where copper limitations apply

## Season-long spray program example

**For susceptible vinifera in high-pressure humid regions:**

| Timing | Product | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 4-6" shoots | Mancozeb or copper | Begin if wet weather |
| Pre-bloom | Mancozeb or copper | |
| Bloom | Copper + phosphorous acid | Critical timing |
| Post-bloom +10 days | Rotate product | |
| Post-bloom +20 days | Mancozeb or copper | Berry susceptibility declining |
| Post-bloom +30 days | Optional based on weather | Berries becoming resistant |
| Pre-harvest (if needed) | Captan (0-day PHI) | Mancozeb PHI is 66 days |
| Post-harvest | Copper | Reduce overwintering inoculum |

**Adjustments:**
- Dry weather: Extend intervals or skip applications
- Wet weather: Shorten to 7-day intervals
- Resistant varieties: Reduce frequency significantly
- Low-pressure regions (CA, High Desert): May not need DM program at all

## Decision guide: Do I need to spray for downy mildew?

**YES, prioritize DM management if:**
- Located in Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, or Great Lakes
- Growing *V. vinifera* varieties
- Regular rainfall during growing season
- History of DM in your vineyard
- Wet spring/early summer forecast

**NO, DM is low priority if:**
- Located in California, High Desert, dry PNW
- Growing resistant varieties (Muscadine, cold-hardy hybrids)
- Dry summer climate with <2" rain May-August
- Using drip irrigation with no overhead wetting

**When in doubt:** Scout for oil spots on leaves after rain events. If found, implement spray program immediately.
