What I want is for "generate vine tag" button to simply create a download of stl files. ... So this is pretty complex so let's break it down into milestones. First we need to add routes for each vine keeping in mind that the vines can be migrated from block to block which means that the url should not include it's block in it. Then let's get a library that takes a url and generates qr codes for us. Ideally we'd like a library that allows us to style the qr code (round vs square, combined dots vs separate, etc) but that is not essential to getting this milestone. The qr code needs to be output as an svg file. Let's hook that up to a context aware button that generates qr codes for the vineyard, the block, or a single vine and initiates a download of the svg(s).

That is milestone 1. The next milestone is to get the qr code to convert to an stl file before it downloads. The stl file format will likely require some configuration. But once configured, we should be able to get the qr code svg transformed into an stl and download on click.

Milestone 3 will be getting the stl enhanced to include a layer that provides a stake that can be inserted into the ground with the qr code on the top of it
